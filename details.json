        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents a Japanese-Inspired Streetwear Apparel Brand, which has attracted a loyal customer base for their uniquely designed products. Japanese brands like UNIQLO have established a strong and rapidly growing presence in the United States, with their popularity increasing every year. This momentum has set the stage for further expansion, positioning the brand to capitalize on the ongoing growth of the Japanese apparel market in the U.S.\nThis brand has won over a devoted customer base of men between the ages of 18 and 55 with their signature products manufactured directly for them and sold under their brand name. Demand for their products generates 250,000+ unique visitors every month and the company is enjoying 35% profit growth in 2024 over 2023. The brand is sticky and well recognized in social media.\nFor consumers who put an emphasis on style, these products have become renowned for having the perfect fit either for leisurely time at home or a night out. With an Average Order Value of $73.50, the company is now processing 90+ orders a day, while a streamlined global fulfillment system and a thriving social media marketing campaign have brought them an increasingly loyal customer demographic.\nTheir sales do well year-round, and the company enjoys peaks around the holidays as their SKUs have become popular gifting items. It’s notable that the company just launched two new products and can continue introducing new products for upsells.\nAn additional strength for an interested buyer is how highly automated this business is now that ownership has invested in people and infrastructure. The seller employs a staff to manage day to day operations, giving the owner time to focus on inventory management, KPI monitoring, and growth initiatives. The business was designed for minimal owner involvement, and the seller now works as little as an hour per week running this highly efficient operation. Logistics are managed by 3PL partners.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it through additional marketing campaigns, affiliate development, developing an influencer network and expanding to an international audience.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Growing Market.This remains a vibrant and fast-growing industry. The global Streetwear Market was valued at $325.28 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $637.13 billion by 2032, a 7.89% growth rate. Known for its bold logo graphics and unconventional designs, streetwear has become enormously popular and includes numerous additional products such as oversized tees, hoodies, streetwear jeans, and even sneakers. This company has figured out how to be a trailblazer and innovator in this niche field, expertly combining fashion and function and providing comfort in everyday apparel. With the international streetwear market growing vibrantly, this brand is well positioned to grow through product expansion, a global launch, and new approaches to its digital marketing plan.\n2.Superior Products.Apparel is a notoriously competitive field, but this business has advanced past competitors with their flagship product, the Shinbo Harem Pants. The success of that product has led to a curated product line of 11 parent SKUs, each one attracting upsells and cross sells due to their distinguishable style, design, craftsmanship and versatility. No one else is selling these designs. While their flagship product is 65% of sales, the company is enjoying steady growth on their newer SKUs. Having launched two additional proprietary designs in November 2024, their expanding catalog of exclusive brand products has helped this company differentiate itself from what competitors are offering.\n3.Creative Marketing.The company has built up its faithful audience through a smart digital marketing campaign that includes running ads on popular social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram, and tapping into a massive database of 81,000+ email subscribers for newsletters that promote upsells. It’s working, since the company’s repeat purchase rate just shot up by 10%. There are additional marketing tools for a new owner to take advantage of, including having the website fully optimized for SEO, adding a blog, and running PPC ads on Google to drive sales higher. The new owner could also start partnerships with social media influencers known for their expertise in apparel, including streetwear products.\nThe Company\nLaunched in May 2022, this company has excelled in the past three years and now offers a very hands-off operation to the new owner. The seller worked hard to achieve a level of operational efficiency that is ideal for a buyer looking for a company that practically runs itself.\nSince global 3PL partners manage fulfillment and the company has trusted and valued relationships with its suppliers, a new owner is looking at a minimal amount of owner involvement needed on a daily basis, while at the same time the company is ideally positioned for fast growth. That includes the appeal of a new subscription model that offers customers curated monthly apparel boxes. Each subscription would become a reliable source for steady recurring revenue.\nThis is a profitable company with a well-established brand in the popular streetwear vertical, which has received glowing reviews from its customer base. As the streetwear market keeps booming, it’s clear this company has built a solid foundation to grow and become a leader in this niche space.",

        "title": "Online Agency for Surrogacy & Egg Donations | 75% Margins | $9,325 AOV | Zero Ad Spend | Fully Automated",
        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents a growing Online Agency for Egg Donation and Surrogacy Services. The company serves an exclusive clientele of high-profile, high-earning individuals such as Hollywood celebrities, Silicon Valley professionals, Wall Street Professionals, and Real Estate Developers. They target these clients with their exceptional database of similarly high-profile egg donors that includes Professional Models and Ivy League Graduates.\nTheir egg donor service is their most popular revenue source, accounting for 95% of total sales at a price of $8,500. Their surrogate service, meanwhile, is priced at $25,000 per surrogate. This leads to an AOV of $9,325 and healthy 75% margins.\nTheir services also include personalized guidance to intended parents throughout their family-building journey, administrative and logistical coordination, and collaborations with agencies, fertility clinics, and legal professionals.\nThe company’s consumer base primarily consists of clients between the ages of 35 and 50, who are often in their peak earning years or at a stage where they are ready to start families. And the company is national in scope – an online resource that has the power to attract clients from regions all over the US, especially those with limited access to surrogacy and egg donation options.\nAs an aspiring parent may want a child at any point in the year, the brand has no seasonality to speak of.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Healthy Organic Traffic.The brand’s satisfied clients often refer others to their services or provide client testimonials and donor success stories that act as valuable proprietary marketing assets. The company also has brochures, videos, and advertising content developed in-house, which they use to supplement their organic traffic.\nThe enthusiasm their clients have for the brand has allowed the company to grow primarily through word-of-mouth referrals, with minimal marketing efforts or ad spend.\n2.Extensive Company Assets.Outside of their substantial marketing materials, the company boasts an extensive portfolio of brand assets. These include, but aren’t limited to, their curated database of egg donors and surrogates, their trademarked name and logo, their operational frameworks, website, and digital assets.\nThe agency also has unique legal agreements, contracts, and templates developed for clients and donors alike, which ensure compliance and protect the business. These assets will offer a buyer an excellent foundation to work with and build upon post-purchase.\n3.Strong Client Retention.Many clients stay with them until they can successfully have a child, making for a strong retention rate. Additionally, many clients return for additional cycles if they’re interested in having other children or working with a second egg donor.\nThis leads to their estimated client LTV falling between $50,000 and $100,000.\nScale Opportunities\nThere is a wealth of scale opportunities available to this agency, which, if correctly implemented, can quickly take them to the next level of growth.\nThe easiest low-hanging fruit would involve the pricing of their services. The agency’s prices are currently below market standard, with some of their less exclusive competitors already charging a higher amount. By raising their prices, a buyer could see a quick increase in profit soon after purchase.\nFrom there, a buyer could improve the agency’s offerings by diversifying their services and offering custom packages, which could include additional services like expedited matches or comprehensive consultations.\nThey could also roll out a subscription-based access membership model, which would give them a steady flow of recurring revenue from clients who are with the brand for prolonged periods of time.\nThe company could further improve their services by expanding their database to include new egg donors and increasing their fertility clinic partnerships. They could then invest in additional advertising efforts such as digital marketing or a stronger referral network, boosting their publicity.\nAdditional marketing efforts would also allow them to more easily pursue international expansion, targeting a valuable consumer base of clients that prefer the legal protections, advanced medical facilities, and large pool of qualified donors that are available in the US.\nConclusion\nThis agency excels in providing high-quality services tailored to their clients’ unique needs, giving them access to a lucrative consumer base. With the global surrogacy market thriving, the company is in an excellent position to grow.",

This leading brand focuses on improving product quality. They offer over 200 collapsible and easy-to-transport SKUs. These SKUs are made for parents and coaches who want to bring revolution to youth sports experience. The company’s success is supported by strong relationships with professional athlete endorsers, helping to solidify their status as a trusted and top brand.\nThe Company\nThe business generates approximately 90% of their sales through Amazon using a highly efficient FBA model, with the remaining 10% coming from their D2C Shopify website. A key highlight of this operation is their extraordinary return on ad spend (ROAS) of 19.56% on Amazon, underscoring the company’s ability to optimize advertising campaigns for profitability. The average order value consistently stands at $100, reflecting a well-balanced pricing strategy across their product portfolio. Additionally, no single SKU comprises more than 15% of sales, ensuring diversification and minimizing risk.\nOperational Infrastructure\nThe business is streamlined and scalable, with an experienced team in place.

This allows the company set their prices confidently and builds customer loyalty.\n2.Remarkable Operational Infrastructure:This business boasts a well-oiled operational setup, including a team of sourcing and quality control professionals in China and a 23,000+ square-foot warehouse in the U.S. With inventory stocked to meet demand and no reliance on DropShipping, the business is primed for seamless transitions and scalability. The existing infrastructure allows a new owner to focus on growth rather than foundational work.\n3.Scalability Through Untapped Growth Channels:While the company has already achieved impressive success, there are numerous avenues for expansion. With an 80,000+ customer email database and a solid foundation on Amazon, opportunities exist to optimize advertising, enhance SEO, launch a more aggressive email marketing campaign, and expand into additional marketplaces like Walmart. This business presents a rare chance to take an already thriving operation to new heights with strategic marketing efforts.\nThis company represents a rare combination of strong fundamentals, proprietary offerings, and massive growth potential, making it an excellent opportunity for a U.S. buyer ready to invest in a scalable market.",

Those rapid shifts have included embracing a more diverse range of body types and appearances.\nAs this agency recognized, a lot of that change was coming from popular images on social media of influencers with different body types.

The energy revolution is on and solar is projected to be a key driver of that growth, a factor that will benefit this company immensely in the coming years.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly by expanding into additional states, targeting more commercial properties, and adding new products and services such as electric vehicle chargers.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.A Highly Automated Business.Because of the company’s streamlined operational structure, there is minimal involvement on a daily basis from the seller, who devotes as little as 5 hours each week to managing the business. Daily tasks are managed by an experienced team, which includes 15 sales contractors and a full-time assistant who oversees each project. The business’ Customer Relations Management software provides lead tracking, project management, and smooth communications with contractors, bringing high efficiency to how this company operates. The sales team has done an exceptional job explaining to customers how their work will add more value to their home, help them save money on utility bills, and give them a greater return on their investment in the long run.\n2.Providing Critical Services.The increasing number of homes and commercial properties turning to solar contracts demonstrates how much value this company brings to each project. Solar roofing and electric panel installation are critical services within a booming industry. Growth within the solar energy sector is hardly limited to California, and this company has excellent opportunities to go beyond the Golden State and Puerto Rico and explore a nationwide geographic expansion. The company will benefit from highly enthusiastic reviews and testimonials they have received from satisfied customers, who have also praised the company’s established relationships with finance partners for zero-down payment plans, which is also boosting sales.\n3.Strong Scale Opportunities.Digital marketing through Meta platforms, at an average lead cost of $40, has helped the company build brand recognition, but there are certainly other marketing tools a new owner could employ to grow the business further. That could include running PPC ads on Google, having the website fully optimized for SEO, adding an educational blog to the website, and using video marketing on sites such as YouTube and TikTok to demonstrate how effective past projects have been. The company could also expand its product portfolio to include electric vehicle (EV) chargers and battery storage solutions and put a stronger emphasis on commercial solar projects that can include businesses, office buildings, municipal government buildings, and resorts and hotels. There is no question that a fast-growing number of commercial property owners are looking for energy-efficient solutions to reduce operational costs.\nThe Company\nLaunched nearly 5 years ago, this has become a highly profitable solar installation business that is riding the wave of interest in renewable energy. The company maintains a strong lead generation system, which will be transferred to the next owner.\nTheir system is so finely tuned that projects can usually get completed within six weeks, with another two weeks to get the new system to be activated. That fast turnaround has impressed customers and so have the results of their work.\nIn future years, homeowners will definitely benefit from going solar. Doing so raises the value of their home, and more Americans are recognizing that installing solar power is a wise long-term investment. This company has done an outstanding job convincing customers that their installation work increases the chances of a home selling faster and at a higher price, and the company is contributing to the environment by helping to cut carbon emissions. Just as millions of homeowners and commercial property owners with solar help preserve the environment for future generations, a new owner of this business can not only scale it quickly but also establish very strong green credentials.",

        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents an SBA Pre-Qualified Company in the Beauty Products and Cosmetics niche, by acquiring this fast-growing eCommerce Brand offering its specialized line of Lip Care Products, made for them according to their own popular and in-house developed, proprietary formulations. Sold at appealingly affordable prices, with a vibrant social media campaign attracting new customers, the company’s brand loyalty is soaring as they continue introducing new seasonal flavors. The company’s Repeat Customer Rate has shot up to 27% as more than 750,000+ people have become followers on their social media accounts.\nAs an SBA Pre-Qualified Business, a Qualified Buyer can place as little as 10% down and amortize the balance of the SBA loan over a 10-year period, all at market-leading interest rates. This allows for a much faster ROI for a buyer.\nIn addition to their unique, premium-quality lip products, which are manufactured directly for them, the company has built its reputation on something else: packaging. Instead of standard packaging, orders are shipped in charming, uniquely designed honey pot containers frequently cited by customers in glowing reviews as a top selling point. The combination of specialized lip products and superior, creative packaging has been a winning formula for them. And the products make excellent gifts.\nTheir revenues have been on a solid upward trajectory in the past three years, with an impressive 68.5% year-over-year increase in sales from 2022 to 2023 and a 56% TTM vs 2023 Growth Rate in Profit. As their brand recognition has gotten stronger, the company has added new accessories and subscription services, and an expansion onto new sales channels, including Amazon.  As new flavors have been launched, the company has enjoyed revenue spikes as high as $108,000 in a single day.\nBesides their packaging and skilled marketing, a new owner will acquire a profitable business with a successful and low-cost operating model, and rising sales on their Amazon and TikTok shops. This business operates in an enormously profitable and evergreen Beauty Brand vertical. In 2024, the Global Lip Products market is expected to generate $22.11 billion in revenue, and projected to continue growing at 4.03% through 2029, as the ongoing trend toward personal grooming and wellness drives sales higher. The COVID-19 pandemic also massively impacted the sales of lip care & beauty products, particularly through online stores.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly by expanding sales internationally, introducing new products, targeting B2B sales to retailers and beauty care shops, and expanding sales channels to include major online platforms such as Walmart and Etsy.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Expanded Sales Channels.To boost sales, the company recently expanded its sales channels beyond its Shopify website. Both the new Amazon storefront and TikTok shop are enjoying rising sales as more customers discover them. There are major opportunities to scale the Amazon store even further, including by running PPC ads on the platform to introduce their products to a wider number of customers, and an international expansion into Amazon’s foreign platforms. Since lip care, beauty and wellness represent a global industry, there are enormous possibilities for this brand’s products to become top sellers in other nations.\n2.Creative Marketing.A major strength a new owner gets is the company’s highly successful digital marketing strategy, which has become a solid engine for growth. The company’s social media marketing has brought them 77,000+ followers on Instagram and an additional 71,000+ on TikTok, which is not only building brand recognition but delivering high levels of organic traffic to its Shopify website. The site now attracts 200,000+ unique visitors each month. The company also connects with its existing customer base through newsletters to the 68,000+ email subscribers it maintains in its database, and another 70,000+ subscribers for the brand’s text messaging campaigns. The company bolsters these campaigns  by employing customer service representatives who respond to comments and direct messages on social media, which drives customer engagement significantly higher.\n3.An Automated Business.This turnkey operation virtually runs itself, so the seller devotes just 5 hours per week to running the company. The seller is assisted by a team of six contractors who manage tasks that include customer service and social media marketing, while the current ownership reviews weekly ad metrics and creatives and focuses on growing the Amazon and TikTok sales platform. While the company has used a 3PL to manage inventory, they are transitioning more of their orders to Fulfillment by Amazon for shipping and customer service. Operations are strong enough that the company can process 500+ orders per day. All told, the company has sold products to 150,000+ customers. In return, many of those customers have given the company plenty of strong 5-star reviews. The business also benefits from working with two trusted suppliers that are manufacturing their SKUs.\nThe Company\nLaunched in June 2021, the company quickly attracted buyers with its lip balm products formulated with propolis extract, a mixture of pollen and beeswax collected by bees. This extract is renowned for providing gentle, soothing healing to chapped lips while making them look soft and moisturized. Their catalog also includes accessories such as lip mask treatments and face moisturizers, which have helped boost upsells. To accommodate those buyers, the company offers a monthly subscription service for those who don’t want to bother reordering once their lip balm runs out.\nWith sales now remaining steady throughout the year, their demographics include women ages 40 and older who have responded so positively to the quality of the company’s lip balms, the adorable packaging, and the brand’s affordable pricing. All three ingredients have helped the brand stand out in a competitive field.\nWith rising recurring revenues, their firmly established brand loyalty, a low-cost drop model, and an exceptional social media presence, it should be clear to an ambitious investor that this is an excellent opportunity to acquire an experienced beauty brand, then scale this business into a true industry leader.",

They have gained a competitive edge through the development of a sophisticated line of high-demand products. Their attention to detail on product development has resulted in a low concentration risk factor and a high Repeat Order Rate exceeding 70% … a level unheard of in most CPG brands.\nIngredients are sourced from a network of 10+ trustworthy suppliers, with whom the company has built strong relationships. The company then processes their products through their in-house manufacturing arm, ensuring a thorough level of quality control that has won over 500+ loyal wholesale accounts.\nThe brand has strengthened their B2B appeal by offering white labeling services, allowing customers to sell the company’s high-quality products under their own branding. While most of their sales are wholesale, 2% of the mix is generated by their small, yet enthusiastic, D2C following.\nThe dedication of their consumer base has led to strong revenue growth, a 38% YOY SDE growth trend, and 18% net profit margins.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Comprehensive Operations.The company’s operations are highly efficient, with strong supplier partnerships guaranteeing competitive pricing and a reliable supply of key ingredients and packaging materials.\nWhile the company recently made a bulk order to cover 3 to 4 months in inventory, they usually order certain ingredients every 2 to 4 weeks. 100% of their inventory is held in two 1,800-square-foot facilities, and they handle their inventory management process with the help of advanced tools such as Katana MRP.\n2.Dedicated Team.The brand employs a team of roughly 10 full-time staff members, which includes a production manager with 7 years of experience.\nDuring peak periods, such as after trade shows, the company also typically brings on about 5 to 10 more staff members for production. This team works in 2 offices, with the first dedicated to production and shipping while the second is used for sales.\nCurrent ownership spends an average of 3 to 4 hours per day meeting with managers and their assistants, reviewing emails, and calling on certain wholesale accounts.\n3.Scalable Marketing.The brand’s current marketing efforts combine magazine ads, tradeshows, cold calling, and social media. As this advertising plan is straightforward, a buyer could quickly begin scaling the company by investing in additional marketing efforts.\nScale Opportunities\nThe brand is already showing steady growth and strong YOY growth rates, with the seller anticipating that, as they add new SKUs and wholesale accounts, their growth will continue. An enterprising entrepreneur can take advantage of this trend and, through the right scale opportunities, take the company to the next level of growth.\nFor instance, a buyer could keep track of the latest trends in the market and release new products to meet demand. From there, they could promote these products to new and existing customers through additional marketing and upselling strategies. They could also allow other companies to private label their products, which would strengthen their appeal among wholesale customers.\nAnother tactic the new owner could take would be expanding the company’s operations by adding additional manufacturing equipment. The brand is already planning to move to a warehouse with more office and warehousing space, and as they could also expand to a 3,000-square-foot space, new equipment would allow them to fully utilize the space, refine their manufacturing process, and more easily scale.\nConclusion\nThe company operates in an evergreen industry and is well-positioned to take advantage of new trends while maintaining the high quality they’re known for. They have a great foundation for their products, and outside of knowing how to manage systems and conduct sales, a buyer will need no special skills to run the business.\nA bank financing option is available for this deal, which will allow a buyer to quickly get to work post-purchase.",

They could also attract even more customers by expanding into new ad platforms such as Google and TikTok ads.\nThe company could generate stronger recurring profits by scaling their membership program, and by expanding into Amazon.\nBy listing their topicals on the platform, they could drive new customer acquisitions, funnel them into their direct sales platform, and use tools such as Subscribe & Save to boost their revenue. They could then further diversify their revenue streams by revisiting their wholesale relationships.\nFinally, the brand could go for the low-hanging fruit of adding new products to their SKU roster. Niche or seasonal products would increase purchase frequency, target new customers, and encourage more repeat sales.\nConclusion\nThis acquisition is based in a heavily evergreen market and has the loyal customer base to show for it. They are in a prime position to be optimized further for an even lower workload, and with additional products and a new marketing campaign, they could hasten their growth and help a new wave of customers rest easy.",

With the Flag Manufacturing industry valued at $8.8 million in 2023, this company has amply demonstrated how to attract customers in this niche space. Offering American, State, Military, and World flags, the company has appealed to a fast-growing customer base that is politically conservative, very patriotic, and eager to buy SKUs that are made exclusively in the USA. That has become one of this business’ most distinctive selling points, along with the fact that its SKUs are fully trademarked and sold under the company’s brand name.\nFor the past 9 years, the company’s products have sold at a healthy pace throughout the year, appealing to customers who appreciate their Average Order Value of $44. Customers have provided the company with highly enthusiastic reviews, noting the superb craftsmanship of their flag and attention to customer service. Their products are available now on the company’s Shopify website and Amazon shop, where the bulk of their sales are made. The company has also succeeded in creating online spaces that enable flag enthusiasts to connect within their online community, which has also made their demographics even more loyal. The company’s Repeat Customer Rate just shot up by 23% as the company enjoys a healthy number of new upsells.\nThe SKUs focus not only on American history but also on social causes such as the ongoing challenges confronting Prisoners of War. New products are often created based on a mix of customer feedback and research on what competitors are offering.\nIn addition to sales in the U.S., the company enjoys a growing number of sales in Canada and Mexico and the potential to expand globally through Amazon’s foreign platforms. Their accessories include flagpoles and flagpole mounts, and the company has explored opportunities for additional SKUs, including flags with sports themes, easy add-on solar lighting for the flagpoles, and product bundles, which customers have requested.\nA buyer gets the advantage of a highly automated business that has plenty of growth potential and comes with a fiercely loyal customer base in a profitable niche space. Their typical customer values the Made in the USA label over price and has singled out the company’s personalized customer service as a reason they make repeat purchases and provide the company with glowing reviews.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly. Opportunities include expanding their SKUs, adding new listings from their website to the Amazon store, raising prices to be more in line with competitors, and starting a newsletter on American history to build greater brand recognition.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Turnkey Operation.The current owner employs 3 part-time workers who oversee customer service and shipping, while many of the daily tasks are managed by Amazon. That includes the company’s use of Fulfillment by Amazon, and their ability to get additional items Dropshipped by their suppliers. As a result, the current owner works 4 hours per day during the busiest season (usually around the July 4 holiday) and just one hour per day during the last four months of the year. For a buyer, this company’s 14 SKUs are highly manageable, and the owner focuses mainly on inventory management, communicating with suppliers, and overseeing the business’ advertising campaigns.\n2.Diverse Marketing Plan.Since the company knows its typical customers have conservative values, are patriotic, and prioritize Made In the USA labels, they have been able to craft a strong content marketing plan that speaks directly to these demographics. While PPC ad campaigns on Amazon have brought customers to their online shop, they also benefit from a social media campaign that includes 3,800+ followers on Facebook and 4,280+ views on their YouTube channel. The company also employs keywords on its website and product descriptions to get higher rankings in search engines, and a blog on its website to expand its customer base. They also send out monthly email newsletters to subscribers.\n3.Efficient Operations.The company maintains steady revenue growth because after nearly 10 years, they have a reputation for quality SKUs and good service. With their turnkey operations and well-established presence on Amazon, this would be a great opportunity for an entrepreneur looking to operate their first online business. The business would also be ideal for a veteran eCommerce business operator, especially one who understands how to scale an already successful company. The new owner would have minimal tasks to handle daily but would have opportunities for immediate growth simply by launching additional SKUs.\nThe Company\nFirst launched 9 years ago, the company now enjoys high demand for its flags leading up to Independence Day and additional peaks in sales around other national holidays. Sales remain steady throughout the rest of the year.\nToday Amazon makes up 92% of their total sales, and the remainder comes from their website. The company has been able to negotiate the lowest cost and shipping terms that its suppliers offer and has benefitted from these discount shipping rates for years. The company maintains an average of nearly 3 months’ worth of inventory at all times to keep up with demand. Small orders usually ship within a week while for large orders, typically shipment comes in about a month.\nThey have small warehouse needs and primarily rely on FBA warehouses and are currently moving to 3PL.\nThe seller is now looking for an investor eager to sell a private label brand of their own, with a good reputation, evergreen sales on Amazon, and a brand website. The seller has attributed much of their long-term success to strong communications with suppliers and a solid emphasis on customer service.\nThere is major potential to build out this brand even further. It already benefits from a devoted customer base, growing revenues, an increasing Repeat Customer rate, and brand recognition within its niche space.",

They sell tickets for everything from the latest sporting events, biggest concert tours, to smaller independent theater shows and more. The company has competitively lower prices and low fees with a buyer protection policy.\nThis business uses their in-house built, highly proprietary software to dominate the secondary ticket resale industry in the United States. The company seamlessly integrates their 3 key revenue drivers: an affiliate-driven network of over 600 niche entertainment websites, a consumer-facing ticket marketplace known for great customer satisfaction, and a white-label software solution that allows users to launch independent ticket resale platforms.\nFinancial Strength\nThe business generated $12.5 million in sales, $1.73 million in SDE last year, and is anticipated to have $5.7 million in SDE – 2025. They have a revenue of over $9.6 million within 8 months in 2024, and this is anticipated to increase in 2025. They also boast an engaged customer base, with 260,000 email subscribers and 90,000 social media follows. Their affiliate network drives traffic using AI and SEO-driven content strategies, ensuring consistent performance across all channels. Customer satisfaction is a key strength of the business, with their platform enjoying an excellent reputation with over 12,900 reviews averaging 4.6/5 stars. Meanwhile, their website empowers other businesses by offering a turnkey ticket reseller solution, further expanding the company’s reach.\nOperations & Scale\nThe company is well positioned for growth, with so many opportunities already researched and developed … and ready to be implemented. Expanding the affiliate base through their sales network could drive more sales, while localizing websites for international markets would help the business grab a larger audience from Europe and Asia. Increasing dependency on internal built tools and automation, including top AI tools, can further reduce operational costs and enable rapid scaling. Partnerships with major platforms like Spotify and Amazon could add valuable revenue streams, such as merchandise and album sales integrated with ticketing. The business operates efficiently with minimal overhead and staff involvement, thanks to their reliance on automation and a well-structured remote team. This efficiency provides new ownership with the flexibility to focus on strategic growth ideas, like expanding internationally or bringing in new affiliates.\nBusiness Broker’s Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are decisive for a first-time buyer looking to get into the ticket resellers business. We are excited about this business for three important reasons:\n1.Integrated Ecosystem with In-House Built Tech Stack.The business uses a 3-in-1 ecosystem comprising their affiliate network, resellers platform, and white-label software. These 3 systems work together seamlessly, creating a significant edge. Their proprietary product offers automation and advanced SEO capabilities, making operations scalable. A buyer could expand this by licensing the SaaS software to external affiliates and businesses, converting competitors into partnerships, and generating recurring revenue.\n2.Established Brand with Excellent Customer Engagement.With over 260,000 targeted email subscribers and 90,000 engaged social media followers, the company has built a strong connection with its audience. The brand’s equity is supported by exceptional customer satisfaction, evidenced by a 4.6/5-star average from more than 13,000 reviews on their consumer-facing platform. With this level of customer satisfaction, a buyer could decide to improve customer engagement by reactivating email campaigns and introducing personalized recommendations based on previous purchases, tapping into some overlooked data to retarget the audience.\n3.Significant Growth Opportunities.This business operates within a high-demand industry and is perfectly positioned for international expansion. Localizing their affiliate network to target European or Asian markets would allow the company to capture new audiences and diversify revenue streams. In the hands of a new buyer, a mobile app could be great for this already soaring SaaS-based company to boost user experience and provide push notification capacity to keep customers engaged with upcoming events.\nConclusion\nThis company has established itself in the market in a profitable manner, and the growth momentum experienced in the last 12 months has been tremendous. This business is perfect for someone who understands the concept of affiliate marketing and, ideally, the ticket resellers world, although both can be learned reasonably quickly and ownership is prepared to train any buyer on these systems. Growth would ideally require someone with experience in B2B marketing.\nThis business offers an unparalleled combination of cutting-edge technology, brand strength, and scalability. For a buyer seeking a profitable and low-maintenance business like the resellers ticketing market, this business acquisition represents a unique opportunity to grow an already flourishing enterprise.\nThe business owner is primarily focused on development of the in-house technology, and thus, is more than willing to roll equity and/or remain with the business, post-closing. As the company has grown, he has had to wear many hats, including operations, human resources, marketing and other aspects of the business that he’d rather a new owner manage; his real passion is on the development side and can continue to be a huge asset to the business as it scales, if the new owner needs such an asset.",

        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents a thriving business in the highly profitable Performance Auto Modification niche space. The company had done exceptionally well catering to the needs of car enthusiasts who own the popular Cadillac V-series car, selling them parts designed to enhance the vehicle’s performance. In addition to its many trademarked products sold under the company’s brand name, the business also markets additional vehicle parts and accessories by well-known names within the industry. This has given the company an impressive 40% YoY growth rate and with 200+ SKUs selling at a high $998 Average Order Value, their Repeat Customer Rate has soared past 50%.\nThe company has also become an innovator by ceasing to sell exhaust products that fail to comply with strict federal air quality and environmental rules. Since exhaust parts are a necessity for all vehicles, the company has found that parts that comply with federal law and can pass state auto inspections are in increasingly high demand. These parts sell at a higher price and for larger profits than the older exhaust systems did. The company reduced its inventory of these parts and will soon eliminate them altogether from their catalog.\nAs a result, the company is exceeding its projections for 2024 and is on course to raise its revenues even higher in 2025.\nThe company has made another shift this year. Having previously provided tuning service work, that part of the business has been assigned to a contractor who handles all services sold under the company’s brand name. Because of this change, a new owner can continue to enjoy the brand’s recurring revenues and profitability without the need for expertise in providing service tuning. Most of this company’s revenue continues to get generated from the sale of performance parts and body panels.\nBy continuing to provide high quality parts for the celebrated V-Series luxury vehicles, the company maintains an excellent reputation within the auto parts industry, and they also attract plenty of new customers by marketing turbochargers and tuners from other popular brands, attracting customers that range in age from 21 to 75. The company has understood from day one that their customers share a passion for their vehicles and want to get the best possible look and performance out of it.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly by introducing new Carbon Fiber body panels, creating platforms for new vehicles, and boosting their organic traffic through an SEO program and email marketing campaign.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the automotive online space. The opportunity earns revenue primarily in the online sale of modification parts and requires. Little to no service knowledge. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Niche Products and Buyers.Cadillac celebrated 20+ years of its V-series performances, and these expensive cars not only maintain a dedicated customer base, but represents a group ready to spend plenty of their discretionary income on keeping their prize vehicle in peak performance. Cadillac V-series cars are recognized as some of the best performance models of the 21st century, and this company benefits enormously from having parts that enhance these vehicles. The brand appeals in particular to men between the ages of 35 and 55 who trust this brand to deliver high-quality parts of their cherished vehicle.\n2.High Value Industry.The U.S. Aftermarket Automotive Parts and Components market is both evergreen and increasing sharply in terms of profitability. Valued at $17.5 billion, the industry is projected to hit $20 billion in the next five years. For a buyer, this company has a strong and valued reputation within this niche space and has demonstrated appeal to both Cadillac V-series enthusiasts and owners of other popular cars. The loyalty of the brand’s customer base is clear by how quickly their Repeat Customer Rate is going up.\n3.Increased Growth Rates.The company’s Seller Discretionary Earnings soared from $175,000 in 2022 to over $400,000 in 2024. Customer’s enthusiasm helped increase the company’s AOV to nearly $1,000, an impressive figure, and the business was able to achieve this growth without a paid marketing budget. Customers have been drawn to the business through their content marketing and social media posts, which are expertly driving high organic traffic to their website. This has enabled the company to maximize profits with low overhead costs.\nAlthough this may appear as a service business in the auto space and service has always been a minor part of revenue (around 10%), the owner has moved the service part of the business to a contractor who provides the service sold under the Tapout Tuning brand continuing to provide profitability to the business without the need for the specific expertise on the part of the new owner. As has always been the case, the majority of revenue is generated from the sale of performance parts and body panels.\nThe business is ceasing to sell bypass exhaust products that do not comply with environmental rules. These exhaust parts have been in moderate demand, mostly suppressed by state inspections. Tapout has reduced inventory of these parts and will cease selling them altogether as will all competitors. The replacement for these parts that do comply with environmental rules sell well and are replacing the “catless” parts, selling at a higher price and margin than their predecessor.\nTapout Tuning has isolated racing activity so as to prevent the cost of racing to be reflected in the P&L of the business itself. Racing contributes little to the business and is a hobby of the current owner. Anyone associated with automobiles knows that racing is a very expensive measure and the previous practice of using parts from inventory to support racing has been stopped. This has resulted in a boost in profitability of the company with no additional effort or capital, and this reduction in expense is not reflected in the current P&L.\nThe Company\nLaunched in 2018, social media marketing has proven to be one of the company’s biggest strengths, attracting a diverse number of car enthusiasts. The company’s ability to successfully boost organic traffic to the website through social media marketing demonstrates how satisfied their customer base is, and so do their highly enthusiastic reviews.\nThose social media posts on Facebook and Instagram have helped the brand connect with auto enthusiasts in general and Cadillac V-series fans in particular, giving them the organic traffic needed to continuously expand their customer base and drive sales higher.\nThe new owner will also enjoy the benefit of having an experienced team in place to manage daily operations. That skilled workforce includes coordinators of operations, services, and social media marketing, and these professionals are available to remain with the company post-acquisition. Doing so enabled the new owner to focus on scaling the business rather than managing daily tasks.\nThe current owner is available to train the new owner during the transition. The new owner does not need to be concerned about the late-model GM vehicle performance tuning service, since it is now being handled by an independent contractor. This is a major benefit to the new owner as a specific skill and expertise other than business management is not necessary.\nThe company operates successfully in an auto-dependent nation, which gives this brand a very bright future considering that every high school graduate taking driving lessons becomes a potential future customer. The company’s high recurring revenues, dedicated customer base and rising profits give a new owner a terrific opportunity to fine tune this business into a powerhouse within this lucrative field.",

The company offers over 60 products in total, which are all private label branded, designed in-house, and sold under their catchy and globally trademarked brand name.\nThey have an AOV of $45.42 on Amazon, and while they enjoy consistent sales throughout the year, their profits peak during the Back to School and holiday seasons. The company is seeing well above market year over year growth in both revenue (35%) and profit (40%), with SDE margins of over 19%.\nA key factor behind their success is their careful selection of retail partners, which has allowed them to secure favorable terms and, in turn, profitable partnerships.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Strong Channels. The brand performs nearly equally well on their D2C Amazon and B2B wholesale channels, with the first accounting for 60% of their total revenue.

They could also establish a subscription-based model, which, alongside a targeted newsletter through their email marketing, could significantly boost their Repeat Customer Rate and CLV.\nConclusion\nThis business has been firing on all cylinders since their 2017 launch, having successfully established themselves in a lucrative niche.

The business is now selling 3,000+ products a week.\nThe company has been pre-qualified SBA lending up to $5 million, the maximum amount available. This means that a Qualified Buyer can put as little as 10% of the deal down to purchase the business, with the SBA Loan amortized over an entire 10-year period, at industry leading interest rates. The seller is also willing to fund a significant portion of the deal for the right qualified buyer.\nThe company has been able to expand its audience over the past 5 years by offering customers a huge catalog of products sold at an affordable Average Order Value of $59. Sales have skyrocketed since the company expanded its sales channel beyond its branded website.

This has given the company a reputation for excellent customer service.\n2.Multi-Channel Sales. The business has a devoted base of customers who are politically conservative and seek out collectibles related to their interests. The company has enjoyed strong recurring revenues by giving those buyers multiple ways to discover their SKUs. It’s a smart multi-channel strategy that is paying off. While Amazon makes up the bulk of this company’s sales, the brand also performs well on its Shopify network thanks to its digital marketing tools, which include fast-growing sales through its affiliate marketing network, which is projected to reach up to $4 million in sales in 2024. This has enabled the company to attract a wide swath of customers, both men and women, of all ages and income brackets.\n3.Efficient Operations. The buyer will inherit a company that has fine-tuned its operations and marketing. This business has 14 employees who manage daily tasks while taking full advantage of Amazon FBA and third-party logistics to handle fulfillment and customer service. The company works with multiple third-party manufacturers who were chosen after careful consideration based on quality and pricing.

That creates a high level of customer engagement that is producing higher sales.\nThe Company\nLaunched nearly 6 years ago, the company is now bringing in $100,000+ in monthly revenue and continues to grow at a solid pace. The results of the 2024 presidential election are expected to give the company additional opportunities to attract more conservative collectors of their many SKUs, which are an increasingly popular choice during gift-giving occasions such as Christmas, birthdays, graduations, and so on.\nAs its sales grow, the company now has an $89 Lifetime Customer Value.\nThe company has enjoyed a very successful 2024.

        "title": "SBA Pre-Qualified Lead Generation Firm for SMBs | 550+ Clients Across Many Industries | Growing Year over Year | 76% Net Profit | Semi-Absentee | No Marketing",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents an SBA Pre-Qualified Lead Generation Business with a 7+ year track record of providing high-quality B2B lead generation services to over 500 companies across various industries using AI and Data Technologies to drive efficiencies.\nThe company’s financials have been submitted to our lending partners for review, resulting in a Pre-Qualification letter, which will be supplied to a buyer after signing an NDA. The reason why this is so important to a buyer is because it allows a Qualified Buyer to acquire this business for as little as 10% down, while amortization the balance of the SBA Loan over an entire 10 years — all at market leading interest rates.\nThe business operates on a lean model with minimal owner involvement and is perfectly poised for growth in a high-demand market. The business has demonstrated exceptional financial performance, generating over $290k in TTM which reflects an impressive net profit margin of over 76%, indicative of the high-value nature of their services. With minimal working capital requirements and a cash balance maintained for operational needs, the business benefits from a strong cash flow.\nOperations\nTheir expenses are tightly controlled, primarily driven by minimal payments to their 2 contractors, enabling a new buyer to retain the bulk of profits. These 2 contractors handle all day-to-day tasks such as managing client inboxes, monitoring campaigns, and setting up projects through their tech stack. The current owner primarily focuses on sales, including fielding leads from the Agency Upwork account, conducting brief 15-minute calls, and sending out templated proposals. Administrative responsibilities include light oversight of the Trello project pipeline and answering contractor queries as needed. All client communication is asynchronous and conducted via email, with internal team communication streamlined through Trello and Slack. This model ensures a consistent client experience while freeing up the owner’s time for strategic oversight or growth activities.\nMarketing & Growth Potential\nDespite its long-standing success, the business has relied almost entirely on inbound leads from Upwork, which accounts for 90% of their client acquisitions. The owner’s established top-rated plus/expert-vetted Agency Upwork profile, drawing 20+ visitors daily, will be transitioned to the buyer, creating a seamless pipeline for continued lead flow. Referrals and LinkedIn inquiries make up the remaining 10%, with no paid advertising or significant outbound efforts.\nThe growth potential for this business is endless. A new buyer could collaborate with niche-specific agencies or influencers to drive targeted leads. They could invest in a premium LinkedIn account to participate in Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and further network with potential clients. The buyer might need to outbid competitors to secure new projects on Upwork by leveraging the proven success of their existing profile. While the business currently focuses solely on cold email lead generation, there’s potential to diversify into adjacent digital marketing services. With proper implementation, these initiatives can unlock significant untapped revenue streams, amplifying the company’s already strong financial performance.\nThis turnkey operation is ideal for a new owner seeking a high-margin, low-maintenance business with opportunities for immediate growth.\nContact Website Closers today to learn more about this lead opportunity.\nBusiness Broker’s Takeaway\n1.Proven Success with Minimal Owner Involvement. The owner works approximately 10 hours per week, primarily on sales calls and administrative oversight. A highly skilled team of two contractors manages all day-to-day operations, including client onboarding, campaign management, and inbox monitoring. This lightweight workload makes the business highly appealing to buyers seeking passive income opportunities.\n2.Scalable Lead Generation Model. The business has served over 500 clients using a well-defined cold email process. With no marketing expenses to date, the company’s client base is driven primarily by inbound leads from a top-performing Upwork profile and referrals. There is substantial potential to expand through referral partnerships, enhanced LinkedIn efforts, and social media marketing.\n3.High-Margin, Lean Operations, SBA Pre-Qualified Financing. Operating at a profit margin exceeding 76%, this business is exceptionally efficient. Fixed costs are low, with minimal overhead driven primarily by contractor fees. No physical location or inventory requirements further enhance profitability and operational flexibility. The business is SBA Pre-Qualified, allowing a buyer to secure up to 90% financing through competitive terms.\nThis offers an exceptional ROI opportunity for a buyer seeking to acquire a business with strong cash flow and minimal risk. The business operates on a streamlined, fully remote model. With defined workflows and automation in place, the buyer can easily transition into ownership and continue scaling with little disruption.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a Conversion-Focused Digital Marketing Agency that has a decade of experience creating effective lead funnels for professional service companies. With a loyal and experienced team in place, the business is recognized for its expertise in Lead Generation in particular, and a host of additional services that include website design and development, SEO and PPC ad campaigns. The company has built its reputation on delivering solid returns on Google ads for eCommerce brands, creating up to 200 leads a month at a low cost of $6 per lead.\nThe company’s philosophy — that clients are eager to invest more through pressure-tested conversion-focused campaigns — has enabled them to attract customers from highly lucrative verticals, including medical and dental care, law firms and legal services, and tax preparers. Their clients tend to stay on long-term, with the average length of their contracts running 9 months or longer. The company now has 55 clients who make monthly payments, and its experienced team is capable of handling up to 100 accounts at a time.\nWith the rapid rise of eCommerce, the need for digital marketing continues to soar, and this business operates in an enormously profitable vertical. The Digital Marketing Industry was valued at $363 billion in 2023 and projected to grow to $671 billion by 2028, a 17.6% growth rate. Digital marketing agencies have been flourishing in recent years, as the world of eCommerce gets more competitive and online businesses want effective tools for reaching their customer demographics. Digital marketing firms have become trusted partners to many businesses looking to scale.\nFor a buyer, the fact that this company has a growing customer base, steady recurring revenues, an experienced team in place, and huge growth opportunities should demonstrate what a strong investment this opportunity is. The company has developed a solid foundation after operating for 11 years, enabling the owner to focus on the business’ scale options while the staff manages client accounts.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly. Opportunities include marketing to new verticals to expand their customer base, boosting ad campaigns on Facebook and Google, and marketing an online course in public relations for a fee.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Effective Marketing. The company has enjoyed excellent growth through a multifaceted digital marketing campaign. PPC ads on Facebook and Google have been highly effective at attracting clients in their top verticals. A vibrant social media marketing campaign has given the brand a whopping 12,800+ followers on Instagram and an additional 2,000+ Facebook followers. Their website is fully optimized to benefit from SEO, and it includes a blog that is updated twice a week. The company also has an email database with 5,000+ subscribers as a tool for bringing existing clients back for new services.\n2.Turnkey Operation. The business benefits enormously from a team of seven employees who manage everything from sales to client accounts to technical assistance. Their employees include a creative director, an account manager and an operations director. Because of their skill and expertise, the current owners work as little as 5 hours per week managing this business, focusing mainly on monitoring finances and supervising the staff. Their hard work has contributed to most clients staying on long term so that the company rarely does one-time assignments. All employees work at home, so a brick-and-mortar office isn’t needed. The owner is also available to remain post-acquisition in a consulting position or to maintain a portion of the equity in this business.\n3.Diverse Clientele. Because businesses in virtually all industries benefit from digital marketing, this company has appealed to a wide number of lucrative verticals. The company has enjoyed plenty of success creating funnels for companies that manage Medicare accounts, provide dental implants and oral surgeries, handle the law and legal issues, and that provide tax debt relief and exit strategies from timeshare contracts. For these eCommerce brands, the company averages 5x their Return on Investment, and 30% of their clients now engage all their services. The company offers a 90-day agreement with a 30-day cancellation notice, but most clients stay on to provide this company with steady recurring revenues.\nThe Company\nFirst launched in June 2013, the company now has a Standard Operating Procedure in place and continues to attract new clients by offering Facebook marketing, web hosting, content creation, branding, and video production. The agency has been conversion-centric from day one.\nThe business has developed an efficient strategy for onboarding new clients, which includes a Kickoff call between the client and the agency’s staff, with new products being launched within 7-10 days of that call.\nThe company has been particularly successful in attracting service-based businesses looking to gain an advantage over competitors. With a track record of delivering solid ROI for their customers, and in profitable verticals, the company remains profitable and growing, and certainly has the potential to scale at an even faster rate under the care of a new investor. The agency has explored several possibilities for scaling this agency rapidly, including by launching an online course in Top Public Relations Methods (which clients would access for a fee of $997), and by selling Virtual Credit Cards to media buyers, charging a 2.5% to 10% funding fee.\nEither way, this business is likely to remain in high demand as the eCommerce industry continues to flourish.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents an established and thriving B2B eCommerce brand in the Consumer Electronics Space, dedicated to delivering cost-effective, high-quality audio solutions to educational institutions. As a 24 years veteran, this company has become a trusted source for bulk headphone purchases, specifically tailored to meet the needs of schools across the United States. Known for its reliable, affordable products, the brand has capitalized on the consistent demand within the educational sector, offering durable headphones that are essential for classrooms and designed to handle regular use and replacement cycles.\nMarket Overview\nLaunched in 2000, this brand has built a strong reputation and enjoys a niche position with minimal competition. The educational audio equipment market continues to grow as more schools adopt digital learning tools that require personal listening devices. This brand’s focus on the K-12 sector positions it well within a resilient niche, where customers consistently return for essential supplies. The emphasis on affordability, coupled with reliable quality, enables the company to capture both public and private educational institutions, tapping into a reliable customer base with substantial potential for future growth.\nProduct Line\nThe company’s core product line is centered on bulk headphones, which cater directly to schools’ requirements for cost-effective, non-shared audio equipment. With a broad catalog of SKUs, the brand sells through a streamlined Amazon FBA model (90% of sales) and on their own eCommerce platform. The business has secured a strong foothold by focusing on affordability and product longevity, appealing to schools seeking dependable and repeatable purchasing options. With an impressive average order value of $250, the brand is perfectly positioned to serve institutional customers, from school districts to libraries and other educational facilities.\nSourcing & Logistics\nOperating on a hybrid inventory model, the company stocks 25% of its products locally while fulfilling the remaining 75% through Amazon’s FBA program. This setup allows for flexibility and cost-efficiency, with approximately $100,000 in inventory maintained on a rolling basis. The business relies on a stable network of suppliers and maintains control over stock, quality, and fulfillment processes, ensuring consistent product availability to meet institutional demand.\nCustomer Acquisition\nThe brand primarily attracts customers through organic demand on Amazon, benefiting from the inherent need within schools to replace audio equipment frequently due to wear and tear. The product line is strategically aimed at B2B customers, with bulk ordering options that encourage high order values and repeated purchases. Although direct marketing efforts are minimal, the brand could substantially increase its visibility by implementing targeted B2B campaigns or developing strategic partnerships with educational distributors.\nGrowth & Scaling Opportunities\nOpportunities abound for scaling this business. A new owner could expand the product line to include additional electronics for classrooms, explore direct sales to libraries and corporate training facilities, or increase inventory diversity to capture a larger market. Introducing subscription-based ordering for schools could create recurring revenue, while tapping into international Amazon FBA markets could unlock demand in other regions. With a strong operational foundation and multiple growth avenues, the business presents an excellent opportunity for a buyer ready to expand on its solid performance and high customer retention.\nWorkload & Personnel\nWith a few hours weekly dedicated to management, the current owner handles essential tasks like inventory oversight, PPC campaign adjustments, and light customer service duties. Amazon’s FBA model handles most fulfillment, allowing the owner to maintain low operational overhead. This streamlined approach makes the business highly accessible to a buyer with a background in Amazon FBA, logistics, or B2B sales, providing a turnkey operation with substantial scalability.\nThis proven and scalable brand offers a rare entry into the durable education technology market. For a buyer seeking a low-maintenance, high-potential acquisition, this business is perfectly positioned for growth, with multiple paths to increased revenue and long-term stability. Contact Website Closers today to learn more about this acquisition and explore the opportunity for expansion in the consumer electronics and educational markets.\nBusiness Broker’s Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are decisive for a first-time buyer looking to get into the consumer electronics and educational material business. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Established Market Presence with Consistent Demand. Serving a dependable niche, this business caters to educational institutions that regularly need cost-effective audio equipment, particularly for classroom use. The buyer can capitalize on the consistent purchasing cycles of schools, where demand for replaceable headphones provides a steady revenue stream. A strategy focused on bulk and subscription-based sales could further amplify recurring income while increasing customer retention.\n2.Scalability with Minimal Operational Complexity. This business runs efficiently through Amazon FBA, which fulfills 75% of orders and minimizes the need for complex logistics. With streamlined daily operations and limited owner involvement (roughly 15 hours per week), the new owner can focus on scaling the brand rather than managing inventory or customer service. This low-touch model is ideal for a buyer who aims to grow the business through enhanced marketing efforts, such as leveraging the existing email list or exploring additional B2B partnerships.\n3.Scaling Options in International Markets and Frequent Customer Engagement. The buyer could attempt to expand into international markets by adapting products for EU and UK plug standards, tapping into the high demand for educational technology overseas. Building stronger social media and influencer marketing initiatives could increase customer loyalty and attract new buyers. The new owner can adopt these strategies to enhance their digital footprint, which could lead to a higher retention rate and new revenue streams.\nThis company offers an incredible opportunity for a new owner looking to step into a proven, scalable model within a growing niche.",

With nearly 15 years in operation, this company has cultivated a strong and loyal consumer base, enjoying 38% year-over-year growth over the past four years.\nTheir crystal products division features a range of finely crafted items, including wands, pendants, singing bowls, chimes, jewelry, and sculptures. These items are sold across multiple channels, such as Shopify, Amazon, and eBay, and command a solid Average Order Value of $309. The company’s catalog includes 300+ trademarked products and over 40,000 SKUs, many of which are top sellers in the growing crystal healing and spiritual wellness market.\nThe training division operates on a membership-based platform that attracts customers interested in metaphysical subjects like spiritual healing and self-discovery. With 24 educational programs, the platform also offers certifications and hands-on internship opportunities, appealing to a broad audience seeking enlightenment and empowerment. This has helped establish a thriving customer base, backed by enthusiastic reviews.\nBusiness Broker’s Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.SBA Qualified. This business has been pre-qualified for an SBA loan, making it possible for a Qualified Buyer to acquire it with as little as 10% down and finance the balance over 10 years at a favorable interest rate. SBA loans are designed to support new owners in managing and growing their businesses effectively.\n2.Loyal Customer Base. The brand’s outreach has successfully attracted a mix of long-time metaphysics enthusiasts and new customers curious about the benefits of crystal healing. Most customers are in their 20s or 30s, married, well-educated, and earn between $69,000 and $82,000 annually. Many use the products daily to promote calmness and balance in their lives.\n3.Strong Supplier Relationships. The company maintains relationships with 10 suppliers, and most of the inventory is being sourced from 5.60% of its top-selling products crafted by 3 U.S.-based lapidary artisans. The company also contracts with numerous small suppliers to manufacture the rest of their SKUs. This has been a highly productive arrangement for the company, and they are not overly reliant on a single provider.\nThe Company\nLaunched in 2010, this brand has built a strong reputation and enjoys a niche position with minimal competition. In the past 5 years, the eCommerce shop has grown substantially and enjoyed highly enthusiastic reviews, enabling the company to offer its customers an extensive catalog with 300+ uniquely crafted products.\nThe company also puts a strong emphasis on first-rate customer service, and they benefit from facing few direct competitors in this niche space. The uniqueness of their products and training programs have increased demand among customers.\nCustomer service is a core focus, and the uniqueness of its product offerings and training programs have driven high demand. The company has a robust digital marketing plan, relying on organic traffic generated from email and social media. It also creates video ads for platforms like Facebook and YouTube, has recently begun PPC campaigns on Google, and has partnerships with affiliates and influencers.\nOperations and Growth Potential\nRight now, 3 part-time employees currently handle content creation, website management, social media, and product photography, with the owners focusing on strategic tasks. After 2 years of compliance preparation, the business is primed for a seamless transition, with sellers willing to work with the buyer post-acquisition to maintain their growth trend.\nWith $50,000 in inventory included and a rapidly expanding crystal industry projected to grow further, a new owner can take advantage of the business’s strengths: a loyal customer base, recurring revenues, and strong supplier relationships.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a fast growth eCommerce Brand that quickly developed a loyal customer base for its Mini Underwater Breathing Devices that are popular with scuba divers and water sports enthusiasts. With a full line of offerings that are manufactured directly for them and fully proprietary, this company has been able to focus on the uniqueness of its products, which are battery-powered and contain self-refill devices. This has made their SKUs far more appealing than what competitors in the Scuba Diving vertical offer.\nEven more important is the fact that their devices are fully certified. None of their rivals are able to offer similar certified products as the ones this brand has designed, giving them a significant advantage in this field. And it shows – the company has a massive following in social media, especially Instagram where they have a highly engaged audience of just under 1 million followers, who consistently post images of them using the devices all across the globe.\nThis is a highly lucrative vertical thanks to the growing appeal of scuba diving and deep-sea fishing in popular tourist vacation spots. The Scuba Diving Equipment Market was valued at $2.1 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow by 4% through 2032, thanks to the enormous popularity of coastal tourism. The World Economic Forum reports that coastal and marine tourism now accounts for 50% of global tourism, as scuba diving becomes an immensely popular leisure activity.\nThis company is ideally positioned to ride that wave to significantly greater heights. As the business becomes better known, thanks to a creative social media marketing campaign that boosts organic traffic, the company has seen its profits rise consistently for many years, with 2024 fiscal year sales increasing strongly compared to 2023. the company’s $469 Average Order Value gives them a tremendous margin, and the company has been able to enjoy this robust success without maintaining a marketing budget. The result is a higher than average contribution margin across the array.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly. Opportunities include expanding digital marketing to include an SEO program on the website and a blog, launching email and affiliate marketing campaigns, and expanding their international distribution.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.No Marketing Budget. The company has not invested any significant funding into its advertising campaigns — but hasn’t needed to. The business has demonstrated a skill at attracting new customers through its social media platforms, which are giving its website plenty of solid organic traffic. This brand’s social postings have delivered just under 1 million followers on their Instagram account, 80,000 on Facebook, and 15,700 on their YouTube channel. This is a solid advantage for them since direct competitors have not invested in similarly vibrant social media campaigns. This organic traffic campaign is paying off in the way it was supposed to, giving the company 316,000 unique monthly visitors to its website.\n2.International Expansion. The business is now on the cusp of making a stronger international expansion. Setting up for global distribution is expected to significantly reduce the brand’s shipping costs by up to 75% since all orders currently are shipped from Australia. The company maintains a database of interested local suppliers and distributors, and this is a business that can be operated anywhere across the globe, including moving the current shipping base to a more centralized region. The company could also transition from stocking its inventory to a DropShipping model.\n3.Diverse Customer Base. The diving snorkel market is projected to enjoy substantial growth internationally as water sports enthusiasts continue to make marine tourism a thriving field. This company’s customer base demonstrates how diverse the audience is for this outdoor and sporting activity. They attract sales from fans of all manner of water sports such as boat owners, divers, and vacation travelers. Their buyers are evenly split between men and women, and customers run from ages 18 and up. Many of these customers come back to purchase new accessories so their Lifetime Value is much higher at $710.\nThe Company\nThis business’ sales are currently generated solely by DTC through its branded website, but there are opportunities for the new owner to diversify their sales channels to include leading platforms such as Amazon. The company could also introduce a retail component, either through B2B marketing to retailers that sell products related to marine tourism, or by opening storefronts in strategic locations. There is enormous potential for this brand to find opportunities by marketing to the pool industry, shipping and yachts, boat rentals, and even to the Coast Guard and the Navy.\nBecause the company has enjoyed such solid growth in the past year, the new owner is in a great position to build on that success in multiple ways. This is a turnkey operation, with the two current owners working a total of 25 hours a week, without the need for employees to handle daily tasks. A new owner does not need to learn any special skills to operate this business outside of having basic skills such as online marketing and fulfillment, and the new owner could also hire contractors or virtual assistants to handle some daily assignments.\nThe hiring of a sales team would also be a strong tool for future growth.\nWith the marine tourism market projected to enjoy substantial international growth, this business with its proprietary SKUs is already demonstrating enormous appeal to the customers who are making this vertical so profitable. The new owner will inherit a smart social media marketing campaign that continues driving sales, solid recurring revenue, and terrific growth potential.",

        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents a Premium Grade Nutritional Supplements eCommerce Brand with in-house developed, proprietary formulas. The company only uses science-backed, premium ingredients from GMP-certified facilities. Since inception, they have sold dietary supplements designed to boost customers’ energy, counter the effects of aging, and improve their overall quality of life.\nThe brand has a loyal and growing fan base with over 2,000 active subscribers. These subscribers, combined with their “non-subscription repeat customers”, provides them with 61% recurring revenue base. This level of recurring revenue is far higher than the average for the supplement industry, where we normally see these rates closer to 20-40% on average.\nThe brand sources NMN, resveratrol, magnesium, and other ingredients from trusted suppliers. As their manufacturing process is handled by GMP Facilities and they rely on a 3PL for fulfillment, the company requires neither the time nor resources that other companies spend on warehousing, personnel and R&D. They have achieved healthy growth throughout the years, with an AOV of $100, a 60% YoY Growth Rate, and 39% Net Margins. Over 90% of their sales are generated through their DTC website.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Strong Brand/Buyer Relationship.The company has an excellent reputation among their customers, who are typically wealthier individuals in the 40+ age range. The environmentally conscious nature and fast-acting effects their products offer have delighted many buyers, leading to a 4.8-star rating on Trustpilot, a Repeat Customer Rate of 40%, and an LTV of $400.\n2.Low Workload.Current ownership works 10 to 14 hours per week, which they spend negotiating new deals and performing inventory forecasting. The company employs 2 offshore customer service workers to handle the 20 or so contacts per day, with their video editing being managed by an offshore video editor. They rely on a marketing agency and an email marketing agency to handle their advertising, with the latter effectively targeting the 50,000 names in their database. Their inventory, meanwhile, is handled by a 3PL.\n3.Strong Product Potential.The brand is based in a flourishing market, with more consumers taking an interest in their health by the day. The company can boost their appeal among this growing audience by expanding their existing SKU lines and launching new products. For instance, their emphasis on boosting customers’ energy would lend itself well to a possible activewear line in the future.\nScale Opportunities\nOutside of product expansion, one of the best ways a buyer could scale the brand would be through exploring new markets. They could sell through additional channels like Amazon, which would come with the added benefit of providing access to the site’s international storefronts. The brand primarily targets Australian customers, making global expansion a great opportunity to target a much larger pool of potential customers.\nAnother opportunity the company would benefit from would be to improve their existing marketing campaign. Their advertising strategy currently consists of Facebook ads using a mix of UGC, YouTube podcast clips, AI, and stock images. A buyer could supplement these tactics with influencer partnerships, which would strengthen their brand image and target consumers on other social media platforms.\nAs their campaign relies more on paid ads than organic marketing, a savvy buyer could also use these influencer partnerships to develop a presence on social media. The brand could make regular posts about staying healthy and keeping active as you age, which would build a community around their products, improve their reputation, and boost their traffic.\nConclusion\nThis acquisition has a strong foothold in a very profitable market, with their committed audience generating steady profits throughout the year. They now enjoy over $1.5 million in annual recurring revenue, and as their SKU roster and consumer base grow, a buyer can look forward to this number rising even higher.\nThere are many opportunities available with the resources and know-how to take the business to the next level.",

        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents an SBA Pre-Qualified eCommerce Brand that has had many customers strap in for the long haul. They have excelled in the watch strap market, with their straps being especially popular among high-income women. As these women are happy to purchase straps in new colors and styles once the latest version of their smartwatch comes out, the brand enjoys a strong Repeat Customer Rate.\nThis company has undergone review by our lending partners and has earned SBA Pre-Qualification, giving qualified buyers the chance to acquire the business with a down payment as low as 10%.\nThe SBA loan comes with a full 10-year amortization period and highly competitive interest rates, allowing buyers to realize a quicker return on investment. The extended repayment terms also offer more flexibility in managing debt than with standard commercial acquisition financing.\nThe brand has maintained their loyal following by regularly releasing new versions of their watchstraps, with their product roster now sitting at 74 SKUs. Instead of relying on a single manufacturer, the company sources from a diverse network of suppliers, making it much easier to design and issue new products and related accessories for future upsells.\nTheir products, which have been designed to suit women’s unique styles and help them feel beautiful, have earned an Average Order Value (AOV) of $52.78, 420% YoY revenue growth and 318% YoY EBITDA growth. As their customer base is happy to make repeat purchases to suit different occasions and outfits, their Repeat Customer Rate and Lifetime Customer Value are both on the rise.\nThe company generates sales through their branded Shopify website and their Amazon storefront, which provides them with diverse streams of revenue.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Capable Team.The brand’s daily operations are managed by 10 skilled and very qualified team members, with 2 of these employees filling leadership roles as the director of operations and finance manager. They also have several customer support agents in place, and their paid advertising is handled by a marketing agency. The brand has an overseas warehouse, with their inventory in the US being handled by a 3PL. They also utilize Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) for their shipping.\nCurrent ownership, meanwhile, is responsible for marketing, logistics, product sourcing, and order management. As the company’s team is highly competent, this acquisition would be excellent for a first-time buyer interested in exploring the online space, or for an entrepreneur interested in focusing on scaling.\n2.Valuable Brand Assets.The company possesses a wealth of brand assets, which will transfer alongside the sale. These asserts include their SKUs’ trademark, high-quality photos of their products, videos, and an email database with a brow-raising 500,000+ subscribers. These, along with their user-friendly eCommerce website, have proven to be valuable tools for attracting new customers.\n3.Polished Digital Marketing.The company has taken full advantage of their assets through a successful digital marketing plan. Outside of their email marketing campaigns, they use an effective PPC ad campaign on Facebook and Google, and have optimized their website with SEO keywords to boost their search engine ranking. Their Ambassadors’ Program, which pays ambassadors a 10% commission on every sale they make, has also been very beneficial for promoting the brand.\nThe Company\nThe brand has flourished in a highly profitable market. As new watch models are introduced every year, they have been able to consistently target new customers, expanding their consumer base and making more profit. A buyer with knowledge of the smartwatch vertical and the ambition to scale could develop this company into an industry leader.\nOne method a buyer could take to scale would be to release additional types of smartwatch straps, such as ones with new styles, different materials, or specialized color designs. They could also create straps for other smartwatch brands to tap into a much larger potential customer base.\nThe company has recently worked to improve their organic traffic by partnering with YouTube influencers and working with content creators who post articles on their site. A buyer could carry this momentum forward by investing in the brand’s social media advertising, email marketing, and influencer collaborations.\nThe brand could also partner with other smartwatch strap companies to cross-promote their products through high-profile co-branded marketing campaigns, or by offering their SKUs in product bundles with other brand names.\nThe brand’s committed customer base, enthusiastic reviews, and rapidly rising revenue offers a promising future for an ambitious buyer.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents two flourishing DTC eCommerce Brands in the Luxury Pheromone Perfumes and Hair Care Categories. These brands have successfully carved a distinct niche within the U.S. market, appealing to a devoted customer base with unique, high-quality products and a strong digital presence.\nThe first brand features a proprietary pheromone perfume formula—exclusive to the brand and not available elsewhere—designed to enhance attraction and build confidence. These products primarily target mature women, who have proven that these products have broad market appeal and customer loyalty. With 45.8K Instagram followers and substantial exposure on Meta, TikTok, and Google, the brand drives impressive engagement and customer acquisition through highly targeted marketing.\nThe second brand focuses on a line of natural hair care products that meet the specific needs of African American women, addressing a growing demand for quality, clean ingredient products. Leveraging a flexible DTC model, both brands operate on a low working capital structure with inventory warehoused in the U.S., reducing overhead and ensuring efficient fulfillment.\nProduct Offering & Unique Selling Points\nBoth brands offer proprietary, high-quality products not found elsewhere, with the pheromone perfumes and natural hair care formulations developed exclusively for these lines. The brands’ combined product catalog includes an impressive array of products that have performed consistently well, with continued growth in 2024. Backed by a well-developed email database of 655,000 contacts and an impressive 7 million website visits in the past 365 days, further scale with just the brands’ own customers is low hanging fruit. With an average order value (AOV) of $30, these products generate steady revenue from a loyal customer base. Both brands also benefit from established supplier relationships that allow for favorable payment terms and reliable stock replenishment.\nOperations & Infrastructure\nOperating efficiently with a well-organized team of 15 employees and contractors handling essential functions such as customer support, creative content development, influencer outreach, and digital ad management, the business outsources fulfillment through a U.S.-based warehouse and leverages a streamlined tech stack on Shopify. Ownership currently spends just 10 hours per week overseeing a team of contractors and agencies who manage essential functions such as content creation, customer service, influencer outreach, and digital advertising. This well-established infrastructure allows for easy management and scalability, while a low cost of goods and flexible inventory financing make it highly sustainable. With Shopify as their main platform and a U.S.-based supplier warehouse for fulfillment, this business operates efficiently, creating room for quick scalability and ease of management for a buyer.\nGrowth Potential\nThese brands are primed for significant expansion. Opportunities include launching new product lines, exploring a men’s fragrance series, expanding scent offerings, and targeting Amazon as an additional sales channel. Building a subscription model, increasing influencer marketing efforts, and introducing micro-influencer partnerships also represent high-potential growth avenues. A move into Amazon or additional third-party marketplaces could drastically increase their reach.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are decisive for a buyer looking to get into the perfume and haircare space. We are excited about this business for three important reasons:\n1.Exclusive, Proprietary Formulas and Established Brand Recognition. This business offers unique, proprietary formulas in both their perfume and hair care lines, giving them a competitive edge in the market. With a loyal customer base, 7 million visits in the last year, and an email database of 655,000 contacts, these brands are well-positioned to maintain and expand customer loyalty. A buyer could capitalize on these brands’ distinct value by further expanding the product line or targeting new demographics with tailored marketing strategies, such as influencer collaborations or a broader range of scent and hair care options. The buyer could consider adding complementary products within the perfume and hair care lines or explore a men’s range to attract a new customer segment.\n2.Highly Scalable DTC Model with Streamlined Operations. Operating with low working capital and warehousing in the U.S., the business maintains an efficient fulfillment process with minimal overhead. The 4 main SKUs drive impressive performance, simplifying inventory management and allowing for easy scalability. A buyer could explore growth opportunities by introducing subscription services, launching additional SKUs, and expanding into wholesale or Amazon to reach new audiences.\n3.Robust Social Media Presence and Organic Traffic. With 45.8K Instagram followers and strong customer engagement across social platforms, these brands are primed for sustained growth. Additionally, organic traffic from platforms like TikTok and Meta provides consistent customer acquisition at a low cost. A buyer could leverage this existing traffic with strategic paid ads, SEO enhancement, and increased influencer partnerships to drive even higher brand visibility. Building a more prominent brand presence through collaborations with high-profile influencers and micro-influencers could quickly elevate brand reputation and reach.\nConclusion\nThis business acquisition presents a rare chance to own two high-growth brands within the booming luxury perfume and natural haircare segments. With a low working capital model, robust supplier relationships, and strategic digital marketing, a new owner could seamlessly elevate both brands to new levels of profitability.

        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents an eCommerce Company with a solid footing in two evergreen and lucrative niche fields. The company markets pre-owned replacement parts for home appliances and has developed a strong faithful customer base that ranges from professional service technicians and repair workers to Do-It-Yourself enthusiasts. The company is recognized for not only having a massive catalog of 6,700+ parts to choose from, but also for its popular How-To videos on YouTube that demonstrate how customers can make the repairs on their own.\nProbably the most exciting aspect of this business is that it is able to generate revenue withno marketing budget, making the company highly profitable and exciting to entrepreneurs looking to earn high returns on an investment.\nAs the Home Appliances market soars and the DIY movement continues to pick up steam, the company has experienced steady growth over the past four years and now enjoys 28% Net Profit margins. Sales are brisk on their $80 Average Order Value, and the company is shipping up to 40+ packages a day. With a reputation for strong customer service that includes fast shipping, the brand continues to win over its customers and become the go-to place for these items.\nThe company has done particularly well at marketing electronic motherboards that control all the conveniences of modern smart home appliances. The introduction of internet connectivity for appliances has been a major boon for this business that stocks so many of the parts needed to ensure these kitchen, bathroom, laundry room and other vital appliances continue operating properly. Because the company often sells used and refurbished OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) boards at heavily discounted prices, they continue to appeal to both professional repair technicians and newcomers to the DIY movement. In fact, once the location of the motherboard is accessed, installation is simple.\nThe company also benefits from having a multi-sales channel approach that includes its Shopify website, an eBay platform, and more recently, the addition of an Amazon shop. Amazon now represents a rising 3% of sales, with 17% from their website and 80% from the eBay store.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly. Until now, the company has lacked a clear marketing strategy. That allows the new owner to invest in proven digital marketing tools such as social media market, email campaigns, and PPC ads on Google and Amazon to drive sales considerably higher.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Strong Supplier Relations.The company stocks its SKUs with the ability to special order if needed. The company has a lock-in supply with its vendor and its warehouse is holding 18,000+ parts because of their frequently rapid turnover of inventory. In some of their product categories, SKUs will turn over within the first day of the listing being posted online. The company uses SellBrite software for efficient management of its inventory, and its supplier relationship includes this brand having the first position for volume with the vendor, meaning pricing and terms are locked in for contracted periods. This is transferrable to the new owner.\n2.Recession-Proof Business.With nearly 7,000 SKUs available, the company continues to appeal to new and existing customers, particularly in the DIY movement. The product mix changes seasonally – for example, refrigerator boards do well in the summer, while range boards attract higher sales in winter. That enables sales to remain healthy and steady throughout the year. With the constant need for home appliance repairs, this company has become recession-proof since new replacement items are seeing higher prices due to inflation, while pre-owned parts provide genuine savings for customers. This is important because many of their customers are looking for savings rather than the cost of buying a new appliance. The company has a growing percentage of repeat customers and a rising number of service technicians who have registered to take advantage of the discounts they offer to them.\n3.Strong Scale Options.The company never invested in a marketing plan, relying on eBay’s internal marketing tools to put their SKUs in front of customers, and word-of-mouth customer testimonials and reviews. With this being a highly turnkey operation (the current owner works 5 hours or less each week), a new owner has plenty of great scale options, including launching an SEO program on the website that uses keywords to rank higher in search engines; and key digital marketing tools such as social media and email campaigns, and PPC ad spends. An added appeal to existing customers would be to offer contracts for service warranties, and the company could market more directly to professional service technicians to get more of them to sign up for their discount program.\nThe Company\nNow 4 years old, the company’s outreach to both professional technicians and DIY enthusiasts has been highly successful, and so has its emphasis on competitive pricing and careful attention to customer service. With the bulk of its items being pre-owned, the company has excelled at attractive pricing that continues to attract new customers.\nThis has been a stable market for the company since there is a constant need for people to repair home appliances, and the DIY trends have only gotten stronger in recent years with information about how to make the repairs readily available on the internet.\nWith customers looking for quality items that provide savings, rather than buy a costly new appliance, their Repeat Customer Rate is rising and the company’s Lifetime Customer Value has risen to $150.\nA new owner will take over a highly automated business that includes two employees who handle daily operations. No unique skills are needed to operate this business, since the eBay and Amazon platforms manage the sales on those sites.\nThe new owner can easily scale this business by introducing new digital marketing tools, but there are also opportunities for other creative scale methods, such as offering customers service warranty contracts, directing marketing to service technicians, and continuing to expand the sales channels to sites such as Walmart and Facebook Marketplace.\nAppliances are a massive and evergreen market across the globe today, and the DIY movement has had a major impact on appliance repairs. This company has been successfully riding both trends for years, and now a new owner has a great opportunity to send profits skyrocketing.",

The company has achieved a remarkable 14% year-over-year growth in sales from January to August, underscoring their sustained upward trajectory and potential for expansion under a new owner.\nOperational Efficiency\nThe current owner dedicates around 20 hours per week to oversight but has hired a customer service representative and a full-time developer to handle day-to-day tasks.

We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Diverse and In-Demand Solutions for Shopify Merchants.This business has established itself as a go-to resource within the Shopify ecosystem by offering essential applications for eCommerce success. From loyalty programs and referral systems to upselling and shipping insurance, the apps address critical areas that merchants need to drive sales and retain customers. The business is particularly compelling due to their high customer satisfaction, with a 4.6-star average rating across apps and a reputation for reliability. For a buyer, the organic growth is driven by positive customer reviews, and the business’s lean structure offers a stable, recession-resistant revenue stream. The buyer could consider implementing additional SEO and content strategies to quickly increase organic traffic and expand the customer base within Shopify’s fast-growing market.\n2.Monthly Recurring Revenue and Operational Efficiency.Operating under a subscription model, this business boasts consistent, monthly recurring revenue with a diverse customer base of 1,900 merchants, none of which represent more than 2% of the overall revenue. The current ownership has minimized operational demands by hiring a skilled customer support representative and a full-time developer, leaving the buyer with only 5 hours of weekly oversight. This turnkey structure allows a buyer to immediately step into a cash-flow-positive operation without a significant time investment. A buyer could consider enhancing the SaaS model with tiered subscriptions or premium features, such as AI-driven upselling, to increase Average Order Value (AOV) and customer Lifetime Value (LTV).\n3.Significant Opportunities for Growth with Minimal Marketing.The current marketing focus is on Shopify ads, leaving considerable room for visibility through untapped channels like SEO, email marketing, and social media. With an email database of 14,500 contacts, the business can launch re-engagement campaigns to boost retention and upselling. The apps also hold the potential for strategic partnerships with other Shopify solutions to drive user acquisition. For a buyer, leveraging targeted email campaigns and exploring partnerships with complementary Shopify apps will drive new installations and deepen customer loyalty.\nThis SaaS business is an ideal acquisition for buyers seeking a scalable, high-demand product suite within the Shopify ecosystem, paired with steady recurring revenue and minimal operational strain.",

        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents a Full-Service Revenue Optimization Agency that helps eCommerce Brands increase sales and maximize ROI on each customer by adding a Subscription Platform on their DTC Websites. This platform develops continuity and loyalty for new and existing consumers.\nThe packages offered by this agency, personalized to each individual client’s unique needs, enhances advertiser outcomes through strategic conversion rate optimization, increased revenue per session, higher average order values, and improved customer lifetime values.\nThe agency offers their services to mid-sized eCommerce stores with enough ad spend to see anywhere between 100 and 200 sales per day. The agency has an Average Monthly invoiceable amount of $60,000 per brand with an average Lifetime Revenue of $2 Million per client (and growing), and an average contract length of over 1 year. As they exclusively work with repeat orders, their Repeat Customer Rate is 100%.\nThe business is doing very well, growing at a 15% clip in the TTM (June) over 2023. The sky is the limit given that the total addressable market (TAM) for eCommerce Businesses that need subscription options is well over 25 Million, with over 14 Million in the US alone.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Proprietary Services.The agency’s custom built checkout process boasts a 60% conversion rate, with their partners’ customers typically staying subscribed for an average of 5 months. The partners themselves enjoy Average Order Values (AOVs) of $31 to $34. The brand’s effective services encourage clients to return to them by turning one-time sales into long-term revenue streams, maximizing their Return on Ad Spend (RoAS) and significantly increasing their overall return on investment (ROI).\n2.Healthy Organic Traffic.The strength of their services has led to many of the brand’s new clients being generated through word-of-mouth referrals from past partners. They also regularly attend trade shows to promote their brand and build their reputation among their core audience. They also have affiliate contracts with owners of eCommerce communities that are interested in potentially sending them business. However, very little effort has been put into Sales & Market initiatives, which a new owner could develop in spades.\n3.Active Planning.The agency is currently working to scale their marketing campaign for greater effect. They are just starting outbound tactics, and are looking into cold email targeting Shopify owners, investing in LinkedIn content marketing in Q3, and are planning to explore paid marketing across Google, YouTube, and Meta. They are also looking more into affiliate partnerships going forward, which, combined with their other planned tactics, will significantly improve their number of potential clients.\nOperations\nCurrent ownership spends 30 hours per week on their primary responsibilities, which consist of leadership, vision, and helping with marketing and sales as needed. Many of the agency’s key operations are tended to by their director-level employees, and as they are hiring a VP/COO, the new owner’s workload will likely be reduced once the VP is trained for their role. The agency’s staff consists of the following full-time workers:\n• An operations director• A human resources worker• A CTO• A business development director• 7 developers and assistants\nThe brand’s development and design are handled by third-party contractors.\nScale Opportunities\nWhile the agency is already working to grow the business, there’s still plenty of room for an ambitious buyer to step in and hasten the process. They could add additional Digital Marketing Services to their service offerings to broaden their appeal among potential and existing clients. They could also hire an outbound sales team to locate and sign eCommerce Sellers with a minimum of $10 million in sales to acquire more valuable clients.\nOne of the most effective strategies that a buyer should consider, however, is continuing to improve the agency’s current marketing strategy. They could add more tradeshows to the docket to gain attention, invest in an SEO campaign on their website, and establish an active presence on social media to expand their organic traffic flow. They could also create their own affiliate network to push the agency at scale. A buyer could then supplement these tactics by investing in paid media campaigns.\nConclusion\nThis deal provides a unique offering for a buyer, with an automated onboarding process to make their service more effective, strong organic traffic, and a capable team. They would be an excellent addition to any ad agency or business that works with many Shopify partners and are actively working to grow beyond their current scale. Current ownership predicts that in the next 3 to 6 months the business will be extremely self-sufficient, allowing them to operate with little direction from ownership.\nThe ideal buyer would know their way around a marketing business and digital agency and be able to use their existing relationships to promote the agency’s services.",

The company offers 15 SKUs that are manufactured for them according to their designs, and trademarked and sold under their brand name.\nThe company’s suitcase organizers and related accessories come with additions such as GPS tracking and anti-theft features which customers have been asking for. With the market for travel accessories growing rapidly as the tourism industry experiences continued growth, this company’s fast-growing sales on Amazon have given it a leading position in this lucrative vertical.\nAmazon has been a strong platform for this company. PPC ad campaigns on Amazon have brought plenty of customers seeking travel gear to their shop, while the use of Fulfillment by Amazon gives the company a reputation for fast shipping and excellent customer service.\nThe company does have other sales channels as well, including a Shopify website that transfers customers to their Amazon shop and accounts on Walmart, Wayfair, and eBay. The vast majority of sales, however, are on Amazon, which has enabled them to attract such a large customer base. Their customers appreciate the high-quality products they’re getting from this brand and have responded with thousands of highly enthusiastic 5-star reviews. While their travel gear is designed to be enjoyed for a lifetime, the company’s Repeat Customer Rate just shot up by 10% as customers seek out accessories such as portable chargers, travel cushions, and packing organizers.\nThis is both an evergreen and highly lucrative vertical that the brand is operating in. The Global Travel Accessories Market was valued at $48.2 Billion in 2021 and is projected to reach $95.7 Billion by 2031, a 6.4% growth rate. Luxury travel accessories have become more popular as the travel industry has been experiencing a major resurgence since the end of the pandemic lockdowns. Pent-up demand for heading off on vacation has led to a skyrocketing number of people doing international travel, and among the many related verticals benefitting from this trend, the travel gear and travel accessories markets have done particularly well. The demand is there for travel gear that goes above and beyond in terms of comfort, convenience, and style than what has been available in the past.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and scale it quickly. The company could develop an extensive marketing plan beyond its Amazon ads, launching proven digital marketing tools to drive sales higher, including affiliate and influencer marketing on social media, video marketing on popular platforms such as TikTok and YouTube, and an SEO program that includes a travel blog on the website.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Strong Customer Demographics.The company has enjoyed tremendous success in appealing to Millennials and Gen Z travelers looking for travel gear that offers attractive and stylish looks, that are Instagram-worthy and stand out on social media. The company maintains social media platforms on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter (X), with professional photos of their SKUs in the hands of busy travelers, and the company has also shown a knack for anticipating customer demands for durability and practicality as well as style. The company understands that its customers want items that provide functional benefits and have an appealing look. This has helped the company attract upper-income buyers to their shop.\n2.Sizeable Inventory.With FBA managing shipping and storing products, the company can offer the buyer of this offering another significant benefit. The sale of this company includes $90,000 in inventory. The buyer will take on a thriving Amazon store with a growing customer base, and the inventory needed to keep up with rising sales. The company keeps 95% of its inventory in stock at its warehouse and then ships to FBA twice a month. There is an additional $180,000 in excess inventory on hand which can be negotiated as part of the sale.\n3.Excellent Supplier Relationship.The company has relied on its supplier for the past decade, and today both sides have a trusted and valued relationship. The supplier specializes in manufacturing and sewing smaller minimum-order quality requests, including this brand’s luggage and accessories. The manufacturer has expertly produced products based on the company’s proprietary design, which is trademarked. Because of this strong business relationship, the company can quickly ramp up orders for the summer travel season between June and August, and then again during the holidays, since these SKUs have become popular gift-giving items.\nThe Company\nFirst launched in 2014, the current owner took over the business in 2019 and has continued to build up the foundation, adding new sales channels and improving their social media platforms. The products had been designed in-house by the company’s founder, and the new owner has launched variations in style and color.\nWith Amazon handling most of the functions of this business, it’s a very turnkey operation, enabling the current owner to limit the workload to just 5 hours a week or less. The owner’s chief tasks include monitoring inventory levels, ordering new supplies, and supervising an employee who manages Amazon PPC ads and a second employee who supervises the Amazon Seller Central account.\nWhile the company has relied on Amazon ads to direct visitors to its shop, they have additional tools for a new owner to take advantage of, including their social media platforms and an email database with 1,500 subscribers.\nThis is a very profitable Amazon business that has found its customer base and has enormous scale potential, including launching new products and advertising in popular travel industry publications. For a new owner, there is clear potential to send the company’s profits skyrocketing around the globe.",

        "title": "Botanical Relief Brand | 48% Repeats | DTC & Growing Wholesale Channel",
        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents a company that is a recognized leader in the botanical wellness industry, with a comprehensive product line that has established a strong foothold in the market. With nearly a decade of experience, the business has successfully grown its presence in Colorado through a combination of wholesale accounts and retail stores. Its range of natural wellness products, including skincare items and pet products, have positioned it as a go-to brand in the industry.\nThe company has also embraced a franchise model, offering entrepreneurs the opportunity to open stores that carry the brand’s extensive product line. With an AOV of $79 and an impressive 48% customer retention rate, the company has cultivated a loyal following. Its email marketing efforts have been particularly effective, reaching a subscriber.\nRun by a skilled team, the business operates efficiently with minimal input from the owners, allowing for a seamless day-to-day operation. This company continues to grow its wholesale network and franchise program, while maintaining a reputation for high-quality botanical relief products base of over 60,000, despite minimal marketing spend.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Rapid Growth:This company has experienced significant expansion over the past four years since its current ownership took over. The business packages and sells botanical relief products through its four retail outlets and two eCommerce stores, in addition to wholesaling and distributing through various channels. Retail now accounts for 38% of total sales, eCommerce contributes 36%, and wholesale accounts for 26%. Their successful franchise program has also been a major growth driver, with new retailers required to sell their botanical product line while also paying royalties on their gross retail sales. Profits continue to increase as the company is not reliant on a few select SKUs to drive revenue, with their top-selling SKU comprising only 14% of total profits.\n2.A Healthy Solution:Known for its commitment to high-quality ingredients, the company sources the best botanicals available and remains focused on enhancing the health and wellness of its customers. Transparency in product ingredients is a core value, and the company was among the first in the botanical relief space to provide third-party lab results for all its products, accessible via a scannable QR code on the packaging. This approach ensures customers can make informed decisions. The business sources 100% Colorado-grown botanical extracts but does not grow the plants or handle extraction directly. Instead, they partner with multiple vendors to ensure a stable supply chain and to secure the best pricing and product quality.\n3.Extensive Product Catalog:The company’s diverse product line caters to a wide range of customer needs and preferences. Their botanical oils include tinctures, capsules, concentrates, and even DIY botanical supplies. A popular option has been their botanical pet treats, which offer similar health benefits for pets as they do for humans. Gummies make up 14% of overall sales, while botanical salves (7%), capsules (5.6%), and oil tinctures (5%) also contribute steady sales. With 10 reliable suppliers, the business has had no issues meeting customer demand and consistently receives highly positive feedback from its customers.\nThe Company\nFirst launched in 2015, the current owner took over the business in 2020 and has since witnessed substantial growth. The owner has also benefited from the company’s extensive connections within the U.S. botanical relief industry.\nThe company’s stores are open seven days a week, processing wholesale orders five days a week, and manufacturing new SKUs during regular business hours. With an experienced team that has been with the company since its inception in 2015, the current owner is largely hands-off, working as little as one hour per month to oversee operations. The company maintains up to $140,000 in inventory to meet customer demand.\nThe business has achieved strong organic traffic growth without a marketing budget. This has been accomplished through educational blog content, email blasts sent to a subscriber list of over 60,000, and consistent social media posts on Instagram and X. A new owner could significantly scale the business through an active digital marketing strategy.\nAdditionally, opportunities exist to increase the number of approved franchises and ramp up production—currently at only 25% capacity—to meet larger order volumes from distributors. With a capable team already managing daily operations, a new owner could take advantage of the business’s growth potential to become a national leader in the botanical relief sector.",

        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents a seasoned 16+ year Furniture Brand that targets both online and offline shoppers with their hybrid approach. They offer a diverse selection of indoor and outdoor furniture for homes and offices, which include living room, bedroom, and dining room pieces.\nMost of their competitors source their products from China, but this brand sources directly from reputable manufacturers and distribution centers across the United States. Their approach avoids many of the hurdles that come with overseas sourcing, reducing lead times and offering customers quicker delivery of their purchases.\nThey have an Average Order Value (AOV) of $845, reflecting a high level of customer buying power. Though the brand hasn’t closely tracked their Repeat Customer Rates, they have the potential to grow their customer loyalty through enhanced engagement strategies.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Hybrid Sales Model.One of the brand’s strengths is their hybrid sales model, which has diversified their revenue streams and made their products accessible to more customers. 50% of their sales are generated through online channels, and the other 50% stems from their physical location in Columbus, MS.\nThe owner does not need to be in or anywhere near Columbus to run the brand, however, and can run operations from anywhere they prefer: absentee or not.\n2.Streamlined Operations.The brand has a qualified team in place that consists of a full-time General Manager, a full-time Sales Associate, and a part-time Driver. This team is experienced and capable enough that current ownership enjoys a minimal workload of 6 to 8 hours every week. Their time is typically spent handling finance, payroll, and overseeing operations, making for a highly turn-key business.\nA buyer can further reduce their workload by hiring a VA to handle some of their responsibilities and use their light workload to explore the various growth opportunities available to the brand.\n3.Effective Advertising.The brand uses a mix of Google Ads, Facebook marketing, BigCommerce, and SEO tactics to generate anywhere between 5,000 and 10,000 leads every month. This cost-effective and polished advertising strategy has been a key part of their success, enhancing their reach and customer acquisition.\nA buyer can build upon this marketing campaign by investing in social media awareness strategies, which would improve their online presence and boost their sales.\nScale Opportunities\nThe brand has a large amount of scale potential at their disposal. As they have access to over 250,000 products from their current suppliers, they have plenty of room to expand their SKU roster to offer customers more variety. A buyer could also implement a more aggressive marketing strategy, both online and offline, to increase their reach and sales.\nThe brand could expand their reach from the Southeast to nationwide by launching additional brick-and-mortar locations and bolster their online presence by establishing storefronts on Amazon, Etsy, and other eCommerce platforms. Additionally, the current owners are willing to train the buyer on how to expand nationwide, paving the way for even stronger profits.\nConclusion\nThis brand has spent the last 16+ years making a name for themselves in a thriving industry. An ambitious buyer could take this groundwork and build upon it with enhanced marketing efforts, a wider product range, and new online and offline storefronts.\nThe systems and skilled employees that they have in place will offer a smooth transition for a buyer, and the sellers’ training will allow them to buckle down and start scaling quickly.",

        "title": "Baby & Kids eCommerce Brand | Unbreakable Sunglasses, Sports Glasses & Prescription Eyewear | Full Service Optical Lab | 40% Repeat Customer Rate",
        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents a 12-year-old eCommerce Brand selling Bendable Italian-Made prescription eyewear, sports glasses, and sunglasses for Kids and Babies. Based in the thriving prescription glasses industry, their flexible, rubberized frames have been made lightweight enough to float, while still being sturdy enough to keep up with energetic children. Though they target the younger generation, they sell D2C prescriptions and frames for toddlers, children, and adults alike.\nUnlike most kids’ eyewear brands, the company’s products are made in Italy and assembled in the US, which, combined with their status as the only official eyewear licensee for a major eyewear brand, makes them a highly unique name in their industry. The brand also possesses the exclusive right to use the custom blend of material their Italian manufacturer created for them for their frames.\nThe brand sells their products at a highly competitive price point, with their prescriptions and frames starting at $69 and their Average Order Value (AOV) clocking in at $62.80: a number up by 17% year-over-year (YoY). The stand-out qualities they offer have made them popular among parents, leading to an impressive Repeat Customer Rate of 40% and over 10,000 5-star reviews across their products, with this number growing day-by-day.\nThough they sell products from the major eyewear brand they hold a license for among others, they account for only 5% of their sales. The company’s own products generate the bulk of their profits, reflecting the quality of what they have to offer.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Dedicated Customer Base.The brand’s core demographic is made up of mothers between the ages of 27 and 45, who initially find the company while searching for baby or toddler sunglasses. These mothers then realize the brand creates prescription glasses and remember their child needs corrective lenses.\nThese customers often return to the brand when their child is older, if/when they have another baby, or to purchase a set of glasses as a baby shower gift for other moms. These factors have contributed to the company’s strong Repeat Customer Rate.\n2.In-House Operations.The brand operates entirely out of a 6,800-square-foot space, with their warehousing, assembly, pick and pack, and full-service optical lab all being managed under this one roof. By handling everything themselves, the brand ensures they cut no corners, leading to an outstanding product and excellent customer experience.\n3.Solid Sales Mix.Though the brand’s Shopify storefront is responsible for 70% of their sales, they also generate 10% of their revenue through wholesale, 10% from Amazon, and 10% through international distribution. They currently have distributors in 10 countries, granting them a sizable range.\nTheir diversified channels give them access to a wider number of customers and afford them the opportunity to grow these channels for even stronger profits in the future.\nMarketing & Operations\nThe brand is currently operated by two owners. The first is responsible for product development, creative direction, and financial management. The second handles inventory and supply chain management, marketing oversight, customer service oversight, and support.\nOutside of the sellers, the company has a qualified team in place that includes, but isn’t limited to, 3 optical support assistants, a COO, an optical manager, and a logistics manager.\nTheir advertising is run by two third party agencies. The first handles their Meta and Google Ads, while the second manages their email marketing to their roughly 75,000 subscribers. These strategies combined have given their website an average monthly visitor rate of over 62,000.\nScale Opportunities\nThe brand has a plethora of opportunities available for growth, with their sales channels being an excellent starting point to work on. Management has been informed that the brand could grow as much as 40% or more through Amazon, and by bringing their fulfillment in-house, a savvy buyer could rapidly increase their margins and make this channel much stronger.\nTheir retail and distribution channels are also very promising, with their sunglasses line being a prime candidate for increased sales placement. As the brand has never had an in-house salesperson or done much work with sales rep groups, these channels offer a wide open vertical for a buyer to explore.\nThe company could also push prescription frames into optometry outlets, as while the company has a wholly unique kids’ product in the optometry space, breaking into that business has proven difficult thus far.\nFinally, given the exclusivity of their major eyewear license, a buyer would likely benefit from further promoting that line in wholesale channels like big box retail and chain optometry.\nConclusion\nThis deal is a sight to behold, with many unique qualities that set them apart in the evergreen prescription business. The ideal buyer for this brand would have the connections and knowledge in wholesale optical needed to fully explore the possibilities available to them.",

        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents an exciting opportunity to acquire two well-established B2B and DTC eCommerce businesses operating in the baby clothing market. The 15-year-old eCommerce business specializes in custom baby hats, nursery beanies, and accessories that have delighted both retail and wholesale customers alike. This is a rare opportunity to acquire an established business with two highly flourishing brands in the baby accessories market, with strong DTC and B2B channels and significant potential for growth through retail partnerships and inventory expansion.\nThe Company\nThis eCommerce business offers two distinct brands that cater to both direct-to-consumer (DTC) and B2B markets. The first brand, focused on custom baby hats and accessories, has gained popularity through platforms like Amazon, Etsy, and its own Shopify website. The second brand serves the wholesale market, with a focus on unique nursery beanies sold to over 500 retail locations, including hospital gift shops and boutique baby stores. The business originally grew significantly through comprehensive digital marketing strategies but has since downsized and operates primarily on organic traffic. With a solid infrastructure in place, including $40,000-$50,000 in inventory.\nProduct Offering & Unique Selling Points\nThe product catalog includes over 500 SKUs, with top-selling items like custom embroidered nursery beanies, sun hats, and headbands. The company uses live baby photography for its product imagery, enhancing authenticity and emotional connection with consumers. Products are sourced from both the US and Asia and are custom designed in-house, ensuring a high level of originality in a crowded marketplace.\nKey to this business’s success is its dual-channel approach. The eCommerce brand thrives on Etsy, boasting a 4.7-star rating and continuous organic traffic. In contrast, the B2B brand has developed strong relationships with over 500 retailers nationwide, including hospital gift shops and boutique stores.\nOperations & Infrastructure\nThe business operates with minimal staff—just 1 employee handling embroidery, picking, packing, and shipping. This streamlined setup means that an owner-operator could easily manage the day-to-day operations, or a buyer could scale the business with additional employees if needed.\nInventory is managed in-house, with stock levels typically maintained at $40,000-$50,000, making the business ideal for someone with space for storage or willing to move operations to a larger facility. The company utilizes tools like Shopify and ShipStation for inventory and order management, keeping operations efficient and easy to scale as needed.\nCustomer Base & Revenue Mix\nThe company serves two distinct customer groups: individual consumers shopping for unique baby gifts and wholesale clients like hospital gift shops and boutiques. The current sales mix is approximately 60% B2B and 40% DTC, offering a diversified revenue stream. The average order value is $350, while the average Etsy order value is $23, ensuring consistent cash flow across both channels.\nConclusion\nThis eCommerce business offers a rare chance to acquire 2 established brands with strong potential for growth. With a streamlined operation, diverse product range, and opportunities in both the DTC and B2B markets, this business is ready for a new owner to take it to the next level. This business provides a low-risk, high-reward opportunity for growth across both DTC and B2B channels. This company is positioned for rapid growth if buyers can expand product lines and leverage wholesale relationships. The buyer can quickly scale this business to new heights with the right marketing strategy.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are decisive for a buyer looking to get into the baby accessories space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Diverse Revenue Streams Across DTC and B2B Channels.This business has built a solid foundation in both DTC and B2B markets, providing significant stability and opportunities for growth. With one brand excelling in eCommerce, driven by a strong Etsy presence, and another brand thriving in B2B, supplying over 500 retailers, this company has successfully diversified its revenue streams. The new owner could easily scale by building relationships with more retail stores and hospital gift shops to bolster the B2B segment further, allowing for rapid scaling without the need for additional capital investment.\n2.Scalable Product Offerings with Minimal Overhead.With over 500 SKUs across both brands and a highly efficient operational structure, this business has proven its ability to meet the demands of both individual consumers and B2B clients. Inventory levels are manageable, and operations can be run from a small space, reducing overhead costs. For a buyer, the potential to expand product lines—particularly in baby accessories or adjacent categories like toddler wear—represents a clear path for growth without significantly increasing operational complexity.\n3.Strong Organic Traffic and High Customer Retention.The business benefits from consistent organic traffic, particularly on Etsy, where its personalized and custom products have earned a 4.7-star rating. This strong brand reputation, combined with high customer retention rates in both retail and wholesale segments, offers a solid base for further growth. The new owner could easily scale this business by implementing a comprehensive marketing strategy that includes social media advertising, SEO, and email marketing to drive customer acquisition and brand awareness.",

They offer a full range of custom services personalized to meet the unique and specific infrastructure needs of their clients. Their level of customization, round-the-clock customer care, and technical support sets them apart from competitors focused on “volume business” and selling inflexible packages.\nTheir commitment to client satisfaction has won them many loyal consumers. They currently have 865 active clients, some of whom have been with the brand for over a decade. This level of loyalty has led to limited customer churn, plenty of glowing word-of-mouth referrals, and a Client Retention Rate of 80%. The brand also has 50,000 subscribers in their email database, which a buyer will be able to utilize for newsletters and marketing purposes.\nTheir average client’s annual spend varies widely, ranging from $500 to $75,000 in some cases\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Recurring Revenue Model.The brand’s array of services and dedicated clients provide them with steady recurring revenue. 88% of their profits are generated from their recurring web and cloud hosting, with the rest being generated from their other recurring services such as domain registrations, SSL’s, email server hosting, and more.\n2.Strong Reputation.While they pay to be listed on various online marketplaces in India and around the world, a substantial amount of their traffic is organic. Along with their word-of-mouth referrals, the brand publishes blog articles on their websites to boost their SEO, send printed leaflets during New Year/Diwali to existing and future target clients, and continue to participate in awards programs and networking opportunities.\nThey have also received various awards for their services and been featured in many magazine articles and have even been listed on the official Microsoft website as a partner. These qualities generate more leads and add to their brand value. Outside of these organic leads, the brand works with an agency to run their social media marketing.\n3.Few Special Skills Needed.A buyer will need no special skills outside of the patience to listen to clients and/or colleagues, and the ability to give internal thought talk to contractors. They will also need to be able to ready a packaged solution with a list of services, delivery time, and commercials when needed.\nCurrent ownership is open to an extended transition period or staying on in an ongoing support role, which will help the buyer more easily adapt to their new role and responsibilities.\nOperations\nThe brand has a fully developed support team in place, with their employees filling the following positions:\n• Senior System Administrator• Assistant System Administrator• Billing Manager• Customer Care Executive• Vendor Manager• Office Coordinator\nCurrent ownership spends 25 to 30 hours per week on keeping in touch with vendors, having discussions with the CA/finance team, running team meetings, and talking with new clients in certain circumstances.\nScale Opportunities\nThere are a few strategies a buyer can take if they’re interested in scaling. They could start by upselling their services to existing clients and expanding their geographic range to target more potential consumers than ever before.\nHowever, one of the most promising opportunities available to the brand would be to invest in their digital marketing efforts. A buyer could create a budget for paid advertising purposes and set up a US office with 3 to 4 customer care executives to run online marketing in the US.\nThey could also continue to establish themselves as experts in the web hosting industry through their on-site blog and social media channels, increasing their flow of organic traffic.\nConclusion\nThis acquisition is based in a lucrative industry, as the digital age requires many businesses to establish a solid online presence. A buyer with the proper marketing knowledge to promote the brand and their services could quickly take them to the next level.",

With a host of diverse products and services that range from private coaching to educational books, the company has succeeded in helping thousands of clients grow and scale their own successful online business.\nSince first launching in 2017, the company has trained and educated 7,100+ customers who have come to them from across six continents. While the majority of customers are working moms, a growing percentage are men as well. A major strength this company has is the fierce loyalty of its clients, who feel like they’re part of an online community of entrepreneurs. Those customers share a passion for not just their own business but for the tools this company has provided them. That’s a key reason why the company has enjoyed so much success and high retention rates for its Membership program.\nWith the business now enjoyable 55% Net Margins and new customers coming in regularly throughout the year with no seasonal factors, the company has found additional ways to monetize its services. The company has expanded to include an Amazon shop marketing its books, including an international best seller.\nThe company has also been able to tout many impressive success stories from among the clients they have coached, including several who now earn more than $1 million annually from their businesses. Those success stories have been a major marketing tool for the company as it continues to grow.\nIn addition to the loyal audience and solid recurring revenues, the new owner will inherit a thriving social media marketing campaign, particularly on Facebook and YouTube, that has helped build brand recognition and expand their target audience.

That includes bringing on additional coaches to service a larger clientele, launching PPC ads on Facebook and Google, and continuing to transcribe their courses into books to be sold on Amazon.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Diverse Product Line.While coaching and their Membership program make up the bulk of the company’s revenue, the company has continued expanding what it offers and has found new ways to monetize them. That includes an entirely automated 23-day challenge that teaches buyers how to land their next client (and leads directly to the membership), a 3-month private coaching program that costs $6,000 and includes weekly accountability check-ins, and Retreat events that range in price from $3k-$4k and can accommodate up to 12 people. The company also has its Amazon bookstore and has enjoyed success through an Affiliates campaign on its YouTube channel.\n2.Strong Brand Marketing.A thriving presence on social media has enabled this company to expand its customer base and find unique ways to engage with customers. The company hosts a Facebook Group that has 44,000+ members and has been a huge nurturing and marketing tool for them. The company uses this group and its Instagram account (with 1,200+ followers) to post teasers, provide customer feedback, and conduct polls to attract newcomers. The company complements that with an additional 42,000+ subscribers on its YouTube channel, where they post new videos regularly. That channel enabled the company to bring in rising affiliate income. Another significant tool is the 21,000+ subscribers in their email database, which has been critical for their weekly newsletters that provide customers with a variety of resources and helpful tips.\n3.A Lucrative Vertical.The eLearning space has grown by leaps and bounds since the pandemic, as millions have sought out educational opportunities online. The business has been able to outstrip many competitors by offering fresh and original content rather than material regurgitated from older sites. At the same time, the company has hosted in-person events and included perks within the membership program that offer continued monitoring and support to ensure their clients are in good hands and experiencing growth in their own businesses. This has been a unique combination that has given the company an ever-expanding customer base, attracted to its success rate and reputation for high integrity.\nThe Company\nFirst launched in 2017, the company began with a mission to help moms eager to operate at-home businesses while they provide care for their children. With a passion for helping these women succeed, the company was able to grow quickly as its coaching and DIY courses caught on and began to attract both strong customer testimonials and excellent word-of-mouth advertising.\nToday this is a very turnkey operation. The current owner focuses on the fulfillment of coaching calls to clients and managing contractors, which include a social media manager and a virtual assistant in charge of project management. The company also uses a freelancer for graphic design work.\nWith such a loyal customer base, strong membership model and recuring revenues, and a skill at finding new revenue sources and marketing the business on social media, this company is in the ideal position to scale quickly. The fact that this is such a highly automated business allows a new buyer to focus on growing this company into a leader and innovator in the booming eLearning market.\nThe current owner is eager to ensure there is a smooth transition to a new owner, and seller financing is available for this offering.",

The brand is housed in the lucrative Health & Wellness market, offering a wide variety of natural pain relief products.\nTheir roster includes, but isn’t limited to, products that help with medical ailments, like shoulder braces, back stretchers, knee patches, and compression gloves. Their products are sold in custom packaging and sourced from a reliable partner that helps them negotiate terms with their factories and handles order fulfillment.\nThe brand has an Average Order Value (AOV) of $50 and stable recurring revenue, which jumped from $20k to $500k in the last 12 months alone.While their partner fees were 20% of their revenue until now, they lowered to 15% starting in June, and then further dropped to 12% in August. A further drop to 10% is expected starting in November. This is expected to significantly increase the profitability of their subscription customers, giving a buyer stronger recurring revenue to enjoy going forward.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.High Scalability.The brand is currently growing nicely year over year, but still highly scalable. They have the systems, team, and processes (such as sourcing new products) to help a buyer move this well beyond it’s current levels. They could also grow by adding new products to their catalog, further diversifying their product array and revenue stream.\nThey also have a system for ad production that has a 10% success rate, which could be combined with a more aggressive ad spend to draw attention to their new and old products alike.\nAnother way the buyer could scale the brand would be to turn their attention to their Amazon storefront. The company’s Amazon page currently generates 10% of their total revenue, with their official website accounting for the rest. By adding new products to this storefront and increasing its marketing, they could quickly increase their profits and access a wider number of consumers.\n2.Low Workload.Current ownership typically spends roughly 3 to 5 hours per week on their key responsibilities, which consist of overseeing the team, conducting product research, running team meetings, overseeing ad management, and keeping an overview of the brand’s cash flow.\nThe rest of their operations are handled by their brand manager, customer support worker, and various contractors and agencies.\n3.Steady Marketing Campaign.The brand uses a combination of Google Ads, Meta Ads, and email marketing to advertise their products. Their Google Ads see an extremely stable RoAS of 2x while requiring an average monthly spend of about $20k. Their email campaign is also highly successful, with 50,000 of their 250,000 subscribers being active and generating $17k to $20k monthly.\nTheir Meta ads performance typically decrease when scaling. However, they allow for fast scaling and predictable profitability a few months down the line due to their recurring revenue rate.\nDemographics\nThe brand enjoys international profit, selling directly to consumers in both the US and Canada. They see the typical highs and lows of the year for eCommerce brands, with Q4 being their peak season and Q1 being slower.\nTheir average customer is a woman over the age of 60, with a large amount of disposable income to spend on preserving her health into her golden years.\nConclusion\nThis acquisition fills a unique role in the Health & Wellness market, with their products acting as trendsetters in the growing natural knee patch niche. They already have well-trained team members, contractors, and over 50 step-by-step SOPs that cover most of their day-to-day operations. Their core processes are also well established within various Google Sheets and platforms.\nThe seller and current COO are also interested in helping the new owner run the business for 6 to 12 months after the sale. Depending on the buyer’s strategy, the sellers are also willing to assist in creating a plan and informing them of potential issues as they scale the business.",

        "title": "Growing eCommerce Brand | Religious Based, Full Scale Paintings Kits | Uncapped New Product Development Potential | High Repeat Order Rate",
        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents an eCommerce Brand that has painted a promising position for themselves among the religious community. Their branded products primarily consist of their paint-by-numbers kits, which are produced by bringing thematically appropriate pictures to their supplier, who then converts them to the paint-by-numbers format.\nTheir 79 SKUs also include other creative outlets such as diamond painting kits, kids’ sticker books, and other associated accessories, which are great for customers hoping to keep their children and themselves engaged during the 2 annual general conferences of the church and throughout their everyday lives. The brand has an Average Order Value (AOV) of $42 and a Repeat Customer Rate of 16.83%.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Dedicated Following.By focusing on a faith-based retail program, the brand has been able to tap into a dedicated and hungry audience that is happy to explore their products. Though their marketing plan is simple, consisting of paid Facebook ads, social media posts, and email marketing to their 11,000 subscribers, they see an average monthly visitor rate of 13,950 and a decent repeat customer rate. The brand enjoys a steady revenue history and 30% Net Profit Margins.\nThe brand’s demographic has also given them 3 peak seasons: March and September, due to general conferences, and the holiday season, when customers are more likely to buy thematic gifts for themselves and their loved ones.\n2.Minimal Workload.Management is divided between 3 current owners. One spends 1 to 2 hours per week on marketing, another spends an hour on business administration and product inventory ordering, and the last spends 4 to 5 hours per week on order fulfillment and customer service. Several of these tasks could be outsourced if a buyer prefers, further reducing an already modest workload.\nThe brand also employs a part-time contractor who helps with email and social media content.\n3.Straightforward Stock Model.The brand’s products are handled through a 100% stock model and shipped from their 8 x 40 storage container. During their off seasons, they typically ship about 3 to 5 orders per day, with this number skyrocketing to anywhere between 50 and 150 during their peak seasons. They currently have around 7,000 units in stock, which is common when the brand is heading into one of the busier seasons. The brand place new inventory orders about twice every year and uses bubble envelopes for most shipments. For the larger orders, they have some small boxes.\nScale Opportunities\nA buyer will find they have many opportunities with which they can paint a bright future for the business. As their production model involves sending pictures to their supplier to turn into paint-by-number kits, they have a seemingly limitless variety of products to release for the religious market. The company could also explore digital products, as well as puzzles and other creative activities that would complement their existing SKU roster.\nThese products can be used to target both the child and adult markets, as well as the Christian demographic given their religious theming. A buyer can market to these groups with additional advertising channels like YouTube, an SEO plan on their site, and PPC on other key websites. The brand could also make other improvements to their website, optimizing and polishing it for a better customer experience.\nThe company can make their products available to a wider audience by expanding their sales channels. Amazon would make for a highly promising storefront given the site’s popularity and its many benefits, such as FBA and Amazon PPC potential. The brand has also landed their first retail establishment, BYU store, and could generate additional retail profit by working with Christian bookstores.\nConclusion\nThis brand has seen strong and steady growth throughout the last few years by appealing to an enthusiastic and highly committed audience. They have the potential to quickly expand their consumer base with the right marketing efforts. They can also strengthen their appeal among new and old customers alike by releasing additional product types that work well with their existing roster.\nA buyer requires no special skills to manage the business, outside of an understanding of the target audience’s culture and what they look for and expect from the brand’s product line.",

        "title": "Amazon FBA Brand | Sports Equipment for Football Players | Growing Every Year Since 2021 | 7 Years in Business | $50 AOV",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a high growth Amazon FBA Brand that has been operating in the thriving Sports Equipment market for nearly a decade and growing nicely every year over the past several years. Their flagship product is their evergreen playbook wristband, which offers several play sheet compartments for athletes (mostly youth football players) to keep on hand while out on the field.\n• This wristband comes in a variety of sizes and colors to meet different customers’ preferences and needs, bringing their SKU count to 27 total products.• They have an Average Order Value (AOV) of $49.99 and see a strong seasonal return of repeat clients.• Their average customer is a young athlete between the ages of 10 and 20 who uses their wristband to keep their plays by them for quick reference during their games.• They sell to both the US and Canada through their Amazon Unified account.• Their marketing campaign consists exclusively of Amazon PPC with sponsored ads and video ads.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Strong Amazon Presence.The brand has excelled on the Amazon platform, where they have achieved a strong Seller Rating and hundreds of satisfied reviews. Their products are all sold through Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) with 90% of all inventory held at Amazon. The remaining 10% is made up of emergency inventory the brand holds in a modest 300 square foot warehouse, alongside wholesale orders. While current ownership prefers to ship directly to Amazon from their suppliers, these backup units let the brand manually ship out orders whenever necessary.\nAs the brand’s excess inventory is handled in such a small warehouse, it can easily be integrated into a 3PL, a small storage unit, or even a home garage, depending on buyer preference.\n2.Several Peak Seasons.The brand isn’t limited to one block of time for their peak sales, instead enjoying multiple. Demand for their products surge during February and March when the Superbowl season comes into swing, as well as August to October. This late summer to early fall period is popular due to more people playing outside, many summer and training camps starting for children, and the NFL season beginning.\n3.Modest Workload.Current ownership requires a mere 5 hours a week to run the business, which they typically spend on checking their email for orders and performing the usual Amazon FBA upkeep. They also speak with distributors and fulfill purchase orders if needed. They typically order many smaller shipments 5 to 6 times a year and have 10% down terms with their supplier. As they have been growing, the brand is placing orders more often- especially for newer SKUs prone to selling out.\nTheir customer service, SEO and wholesale invoicing are handled by an employee, and their Amazon PPC and account related tasks are handled by 2 freelancers.\nScale Opportunities\nThis acquisition has several strong scale opportunities at their disposal, some being lower hanging fruit than others.\nAn example of one easier scale opportunity would be offering customizable options for their products, letting customers better find the wristband that suits them best. This would lead to higher margins and strengthen brand appeal for their customers. Regarding brands, they could investigate having branded products featuring team logos, which would have a great audience appeal.\nThe brand could draw more attention to these new products by leveraging affiliate and influencer marketing channels. They could also pursue additional marketing strategies to build upon their relatively straightforward tactics.\nWhile the brand exclusively operates off Amazon, they do have a Shopify storefront in place that a buyer could invest in for additional revenue. Other distribution channels and regions would help diversify their revenue and give them access to a larger number of enthusiastic sports fans.\nConclusion\nThe brand’s simple yet effective product has proven highly useful for their customers, who are typically young athletes who might need a little extra help remembering their plays. They have come far in the past 7 years, but an enterprising buyer can see them develop and see much more success in their industry. As this is the brand’s second year offering single variation SKUs for each color, and as the marker is larger, the seller expects there to be plenty of growth this year as it is.\nThe seller is committed to a buyer’s long-term success and can provide a smooth transition period for a new owner. They are also open to staying on in a non-operational role and providing additional expertise as needed.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents an assets sale from a closing non-profit museum dedicated to the history of Hollywood Science Fiction movies. The museum is in the process of dissolving and closing its doors, prompting the launch of this valuable asset sale. This museum contains more than $7 million in props, sets, costumes and related memorabilia from such blockbuster film franchises as Star Trek, Star Wars, Robocop, The Terminator, and many others.\nThe asset sale includes additional valuable offerings, including six website domains, an email database with 9,690+ followers, and eight social media platforms with a combined 288,766 followers.\nThe museum also launched an education component that included Daily Makeup Classes demonstrating the process of creating special effects; classes, lectures, film screenings, and games available daily; space available for rentals, live theatre and music events, and rooms for weddings and private parties.\nThe museum’s organizers do not plan to renew their lease at their Santa Monica property and are looking to sell a massive list of props, costumes, and memorabilia from well-known science fiction and horror movies.\nThis 501c3 non-profit based in the Los Angeles area was launched in 2012 by fans of TV’s Stark Trek show with the simple goal of restoring the Star Trek Enterprise-D Bridge touring set created by Paramount Studios, with the hope of giving it to a museum. When no museum expressed interest in the set, the Star Trek fans banded together and created their own museum, and it soon expanded to include other popular science fiction franchises, as well as a Horror Museum focused on popular cinematic scare films.\nThe museum’s assets are likely to grow in value over the years, as movie memorabilia items usually do. The collectibles industry is a massive one, estimated at $462 billion in 2023. A subset of that, the global TV and movie memorabilia market, is especially vibrant, as enthusiasts and collectors are constantly hunting for rare artifacts from their favorite entertainment properties, seeking out legendary props, costumes, toys, and other items associated with popular films.\nThe actual value of these items has increased significantly in recent years as items are now easy to find on eCommerce sites and through Internet auctions or platforms such as eBay. With the seller’s ability to prove authenticity, these items are in high demand and bring in exceptionally high bids.\nThese items could also be valuable to other museums. There are scores of movie museums across the globe devoted to entertaining film enthusiasts, and they include The Hollywood Museum in Los Angeles, The Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, NY, and The Cinema Museum in London.\nThis museum’s list of assets spans a wide number of movies that were huge box office hits or have developed cult followings, including Lord of the Rings, Planet Of The Apes, The Shining, Iron Man, Spider-Man, and many others. Collectively, these items are estimated to have a total value in excess of $7 million,, while individuals items can sell for anywhere from $500 to $600,000.\nFor an investor who would like to revive the science fiction museum, everything needed to make it a reality is available in this asset sale. That investor would find that the museum’s social media following is another significant asset to a future business or museum related to movie history and memorabilia. The museum was able to build up a collection of nearly 300,000 followers on its social media pages, which include a Facebook page on the Enterprise Bridge Restoration (which has 97,000+ followers), Instagram (37,000+ followers on both a science fiction and separate horror page), Twitter (79,000+ horror fans and 8,400 sci-fi fans), and Kickstarter (3,671 followers).\nThese social media platforms are an invaluable source of organic traffic and digital marketing for any investor who purchases these assets and then uses them for a new business, whether it’s focused on history, or selling movie memorabilia.\nAsset sales also offer a strong proposition to the buyer. An asset sale carries less risk for a buyer since typically any liabilities associated with the seller, such as outstanding debts and contingent expenses, remain the seller’s sole responsibility.\nPlease note that this asset sale includes all items as a complete package. We are not considering offers for individual assets or piecemeal sales. Thank you for your understanding.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a brand that has been operating for well over 100 years in the Event & Floral Supplies industry. This valuable acquisition allows a buyer to acquire a historical brand that has weathered the ups and downs of markets and still continues to be a consistent performer.\nThe business operates across multiple sales channels, including Retail, Wholesale, and eCommerce, and has long-standing relationships and trust built with major wholesalers. Their status as one of the oldest Floral Supplier wholesalers in the country has net them well-earned brand recognition that newer competitors would be hard pressed to achieve.\nThey boast multiple large warehouses that are well-stocked with their branded products, allowing them to offer everything their customers might need to decorate weddings, bar mitzvahs, funerals, and various other business and special events.\nThis company is an excellent opportunity for any buyer interested in acquiring a brand with strong profit margins, thousands of wholesale accounts, and a growing online presence. Their century of experience has given them a dedicated audience with over 2,000 B2B accounts that include wholesalers, retailers and online shops, an outstanding 80% Repeat Customer Rate, and the knowledge they need to build a capable and qualified team to manage their day-to-day operations.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Established Reputation.Launched in 1915, the brand has spent the time since their launch building valuable connections with vendors and customers and making a name for themselves as a go-to source for just about anything that a flower shop or event planner might need.Their SKU roster has grown to over 10,000 SKUs and includes a diverse range of common and specialized floral supplies such as vases, artificial flowers, decor for weddings and parties, and more specialized products for funeral parlors.\n2.Diverse Revenue Channels.While the brand has thrived as a retailer, and still maintains a warehouse and a presence in the New York metro and Tri-State area that allows them to directly sell their branded products to regional shops, they have seen incredible results with their expansion to eCommerce. Between their D2C website and their Amazon storefront, Amazon has proven to be the most profitable, and has grown to be the largest segment of the business today. They have over 500 products available on the storefront, most of which are their own brand, and consistently generate a respectable number of 5-star revenues.\n3.Growth Tactics in Place.The company has not sat on their laurels waiting for a new buyer to scale them. Instead, they have taken matters into their own hands by continuing to adapt and implement significant enhancements. For instance, they have recently added an Inventory Management System to improve their working capital position and to switch their order fulfillment from paper to digital pick routing and product scanning, reducing human error by up to 90%. Their stock and fulfillment operations at their facilities have been divided into specific areas that include receiving, order staging, picking stock, and replenishing stock in order to minimize errors and enable faster retrieval.\nFinally, they transitioned their Software to ODOO, which offers benefits such as scanning and matching items in their warehouse to a specific shelf location, and digitally picking every sales order with a scanned matching control.\nMarketing and Operations\nThe brand’s products are packaged by their suppliers and delivered to them in boxes, which are then stored at their warehouses. Their inventory is handled by a business software solution, and Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) is used to handle their online orders. Each box is branded with the company name and logo. Their daily operations are managed by 23 employees, which include 3 in their main office, 3 in the Amazon division, 7 warehouse workers, and 3 drivers. Though the company has traditionally advertised their products through print and digital catalogs, they have adapted to include email marketing and digital ads on Amazon in their modern marketing campaign.\nThe brand doesn’t rely on any one product for their profits, and while sales are consistent throughout the year, they do see spikes around certain holidays. These include Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day – which stands as their largest sales holiday – and Christmas.\nScale Opportunities\nAs seasoned as the brand might be, there are still several scale opportunities that a buyer could pursue for short-term and long-term growth alike. They could incorporate additional digital marketing efforts such as a blog on their website, a video marketing campaign on YouTube and TikTok, and a social media marketing campaign that includes the use of affiliates and influencers. This move, especially when paired with PPC, would attract more consumers than ever, boost their profits, and allow them to better target new wholesale accounts across the nation- or, potentially, across the globe.\nThe brand could further diversify their revenue by launching online sales channels on new platforms, such as Walmart.com, Wayfair, and Overstock. They could also add to their wholesale and online accounts alike by expanding into the live flower business, which would likely significantly add to their profits since they have a proven sales team ready to market new products.\nConclusion\nThis polished commercial operation will offer their new owner remarkable annual profits of nearly $4 million, a position as a leading national wholesale provider that successfully transitioned to eCommerce, and phenomenal long-term potential. Customers are increasingly shopping for flowers and related supplies online, and with the brand’s expert knowledge of the market, they are in a great position to capitalize on this growing demand.",

        "title": "SBA Pre-Qualified up to 90% | Women’s Protective Undergarments Brand | Strong Repeats | Powerful Influencer Network | Strong YOY Growth | Proprietary Brand & IP",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents an eCommerce Brand that has taken a solutions-oriented approach to helping women with some of their more common struggles. In the span of only a few years, they have raced up the ranks of the Women’s Protective Undergarments niche to become a top seller in their native Germany. They offer high-quality and affordable alternatives to traditional products, and their commitment to combining comfort with function has given them a Repeat Customer Rate that has rapidly reached 22% and over 9,000 enthusiastic reviews across their product line.\nThis deal is a great opportunity for a US entrepreneur, as they can gain immediate access to the European market to start cross selling their own products, and then expand the brand into the US and UK. As their consumer base is female, there are many different product types that would make for excellent cross sells. Their operations are also highly turnkey, which will allow a buyer to invest more of their attention towards scale opportunities.\nThe brand has marketed their 19 SKUs through a curated digital marketing campaign, with a key strategy being their exclusive arrangements with many of Germany’s top trusted influencers. This tactic allowed them to achieve rapid market penetration and, due to offering such high-quality and affordable alternatives to what was available in Germany at the time, sent demand for their products skyrocketing. They bolster the traffic they generate through influencers by utilizing their over 488,000 email and SMS text subscribers, which makes it easier for them to engage with their customers and strengthen their brand/buyer relationship.\nTheir innovative underwear products, which feature numerous top sellers, generated strong brand awareness within a remarkably short timeframe. They have grown increasingly popular in Germany through their enthusiastic customer reviews and testimonials, as well as the fact that their products can’t be found anywhere else. Their rapid-fire growth and rise in interest have convinced the brand to expand into men’s leakproof and functional sportswear to tap into a larger potential consumer base.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\n1.Proprietary Product Range.Their proprietary product line, which is sourced from suppliers with whom they have established and exclusive relationships with, are fully trademarked and sold under their brand name and logo. These inclusive underwear products tackle common issues such as incontinence while being comfortable, functional, and sustainable. The success of these products, coupled with the fact that the global women’s night and underwear market is currently thriving, makes their plans to expand into men’s clothing a highly promising prospect.\n2.Strong Marketing Platform.Their influencer marketing has been the backbone of the brand’s marketing strategy and has allowed them to scale as rapidly as they have. They have established long-term exclusive deals with their influencers and have an influencer marketing team dedicated to studying the bond between an influencer and their target audience. They complement this strategy with Facebook ads and Google PPC, which have also been a major driver behind their rising profits.\nAdditionally, the brand makes active use of their sizable subscriber database, which features over 488,000 subscribers divided between their 285,000+ email subscribers and 244,000+ SMS text message subscribers. Their email newsletters typically educate subscribers about their products and provide special offers in an effort to build a sense of community with their customers. They add to this through social media marketing on TikTok and Instagram, as well as an educational blog on their website: both of which provide them with organic traffic. Their marketing campaign has led to the brand having a rate of over 358,000 unique visitors and online sessions to their site every month.\n3.Notable Growth Opportunities.Outside of international expansion, the brand could easily benefit from implementing new storefronts, as doing so would diversify their revenue and give them access to more customers than ever. They could achieve this by branching off into other eCommerce storefronts like Amazon and Walmart, or by shifting from DTC sales to B2B by targeting brick-and-mortar and online retailers.\nThey could also boost their Repeat Customer Rate by introducing a subscription service for their more dedicated buyers, and market their new and old channels alike by exploring new marketing channels such as TikTok and Facebook sales.\nThe Company\nThe brand’s lineup of products is excellent for customers looking to replace their tampons and pads with sustainable-yet-affordable alternatives, with their underwear achieving that and then some. They have also launched relevant accessories such as leakproof nursing bras and period care products such as heating patches. They have an Average Order Value (AOV) of 61 Euros, or $65.51, and while they enjoy steady sales year-round, their profits do rise during the summer months due to their introduction of leakproof period beachwear.\nWhile they have excelled in Germany, they also see sales in Switzerland and Austria. Their average customer is a woman between the ages of 25 and 35, who is typically a mom looking for products that will help her feel good about her body. Their average customer is also very invested in sustainability and eco-friendliness, which is a central theme of the company’s brand image, and something they have leaned into by shipping their products in a biodegradable plastic bag.\nOperations\nCurrent ownership has put together a large and experienced team that includes 7 full-time and 17 part-time employees who work as general contractors. The team is responsible for all daily tasks, from customer service to the coordination of influencer marketing, to supply chain management and product designs. This team has been vital in keeping the brand as successful as they are. The brand handles their inventory through a 3PL, with new orders being placed at least every 2 months.\nConclusion\nThis acquisition’s business model has proven successful in Germany and is now ready to be replicated across new countries, sales channels, and B2B. With the right strategies, fresh marketing tactics, and the right buyer at the helm, this brand could quickly reach new heights.",

They are now a leading provider of MK5 A90 Toyota Supra vents, mirrors, deflectors, and various other parts. They handle their stock through a 90% DropShip model, and source their products through solid top tiered dealer accounts with some of the biggest suppliers on the market.\nThe strength of the brand’s reputation and working relationships is such that they enjoy priority distribution over MADE Motorsports parts. Axis Parts, Ewerks, and Illumo. The company also has several parts that are sold solely through their storefront, with DSG Lighting making a part exclusive to the brand, and they have their own line of products available for sale. Their Average Order Value (AOV) is $1,029.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Strong Position in Niche.One of the brand’s biggest strengths has been their choice to focus on one auto brand and model. By honing on the MK5 A90 Toyota Supra, they have won over the niche, but sizable and highly dedicated, community that surrounds the vehicle. The brand’s trademarked name, logo, and site buildout have all worked in tandem to attract this natural audience, which has paid off in the large number of passive SEO sales they enjoy without direct investment in advertising.\n2.Minimal Marketing.As touched upon earlier, the company requires very little in the ways of active marketing efforts. Most of their sales are generated passively through their strong brand and website SEO, which they supplement through various additional organic marketing strategies. These include social media marketing across Facebook, TikTok, Threads, and Instagram, the last of which the brand gives the most investment.\nThey spend between $400 and $500 a month boosting posts and reels for added attention or interest on certain parts. They also spend $200 on monthly management for their private shop app, which includes shopping, full store access, a forum, messaging between members, reward points, and so on.\n3.DropShip Focused.The brand’s products are handled through a 90% DropShip inventory model, with the remaining 10% being stock. Depending on buyer needs preference, the brand could be switched to a 100% DropShip model, which was initially how the business operated when they first launched. The brand relies upon one large international distributor that DropShips parts for them from many different manufacturers, and also holds direct relationships with top brands that allow for priority purchasing, shipping, and other perks.\nAll the company’s sales are done through their website and app, and while they sell DTC, they have a growing wholesale channel that provides them with additional revenue to work with. The company also boasts the appeal of being one of only 9 HKS Master Pro dealers nationwide, encouraging individual customers and businesses alike to go to them to get their hands on those parts.\nScale Opportunities\nWhile the brand has already been working to drive up their revenue, there are many ways that an ambitious buyer could take them to the next level. They could carry the momentum that the seller left behind by continuing to grow their wholesale and B2B business, and expanding their presence on social media. The company could also build upon their already highly successful SEO and online community by making weekly blog posts discussing subjects such as automobiles, parts, and repairs.\nThe brand could further improve their marketing by starting paid Google advertising and ad word integration, and diversify their revenue by expanding to an Amazon storefront. A new storefront and improved marketing would also allow them to better promote any new parts that they introduce and sell under their brand, improving their profits and broadening their reach.\nConclusion\nThis acquisition was owned and started by a pediatric ultrasound specialist with no business management experience, leaving no shortage of potential for a buyer who knows their way around the ins and outs of running and growing a business. Their SEO loadout puts the brand in the position to be run in auto pilot if needed, with their website being polished to the point where other eCommerce professionals have claimed it should be a “case study”.\nThe seller and team are willing to stay with the brand post-purchase to provide guidance, support, consulting, and other help, which will make the transition process easier for the new owner.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents an eCommerce Brand with a treasure trove of Intellectual Property protecting its Production Cookware product line. The company’s 70+ proprietary Kitchenware Products cannot be purchased through any other company and the sale mix is between Direct-to-Consumer (Branded Website) and Business-to-Business (Wholesale to Retailers).\nWith a decade of experience developing attractive, high-quality products from suppliers around the Globe (including the U.S.), the company enjoys 40% YOY growth rates and increasingly global sales. Proof positive that the products are extremely unique, of the utmost quality, and long lasting given the company’s multi-century warranty it provides as assurance to its customers that it backs the products 100%.\nThe word has spread across the world about the brand’s specialized Production-Level Kitchenware, Cookware, and Knives, designed and manufactured solely for this company, sold under its brand name, and backed by 19 patents. Vibrant sales flow from the U.S., UK, Japan, and South Korea, among many other nations. While 70% of the company’s sales are DTC, a fast-rising percentage is now B2B, where the company has profitable deals with 130+ top retailers, including the country’s largest department store chain.\n[Note: a DTC/B2B sales channel mix is often sought after by our clients given the ability to scale via multiple channels, the reduction in risk from being solely sold in one channel, and the enormous opportunity that B2B sales offers to an established brand like this one that has been in business for 10 years.]\nThe company is looking to introduce a new range of high-quality kitchen knives available at competitive pricing and has the advantage of a backlog of innovative products that are now in development for future launches. Those SKUs are now in R&D and can be placed into production by the new owner, which provides another immediate scale opportunity.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly by expediting new product launches, expanding sales internationally, and targeting its marketing to a much larger wholesale expansion.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nWe are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Scale Opportunities.Increasing both the number of products this brand offers and its digital marketing could easily prompt sales to skyrocket. While the company now enjoys increased sales in the U.S., there are immense scale opportunities for investing more in online advertising within the states. The company could also target new distributors in countries such as Germany, Scandinavia, Mexico, and Canada, and quickly increase the rate of new product launches. With the company’s faithful customer base, this would be a terrific opportunity for upsells and cross-sells.\n2.Experienced Team in Place.The company has an experienced team in place to handle daily operations, with clearly defined goals and roles for each one. That includes fulltime managers of operations and administration, and part-time managers of sales and marketing, along with a part-time marketing assistant, customer service lead, and logistics assistant. This highly motivated team is employed in their main office, and the company also has a part-time agent in the U.S. All tasks, for now, are handled in-house, including inventory management, and a contracted factory team handles fulfillment. The company could also bring on new employees in the marketing department and grow a new team in the U.S.\n3.Expert at Crowdfunding.Over the past decade, the company has become an expert at building campaigns to raise revenue through crowdfunding and then promoting them online. These campaigns have raised additional capital for promoting website preorders, launching new products, and covering all tooling. Crowdfunding has become a creative and popular way for businesses to fund a venture by raising money from people via online crowdfunding platforms, and this company knows how to leverage vast networks of people through social media to attract investors.\nOperations and Marketing\nAll products are manufactured for this company, based on its designs, and sold under its brand name. The company maintains at least $200,000 worth of inventory at all times to keep up with demand. The company is now shipping 25+ orders a day, which rises to 100+ orders a day during peak times. New inventory orders are placed multiple times per year as sales continue to increase globally.\nOne of the company’s key strengths has been its skill at boosting customer engagement. The company launched a Facebook Lovers Group for its website that now enjoys 15,000+ members and continues growing, while the company’s Facebook page has 51,000+ followers.\nAdd to that an additional 36,000+ followers on Instagram and an email database of 40,000+ subscribers as additional marketing tools.\nThe company has built up this loyal community based around the integrity of its products and of the business itself and in the company’s continued ability to design and launch creative new products that customers are eager to buy.\nSales now remain steady throughout the year and ramp up significantly during the holidays. There is little guesswork that goes into designing these products, since the founder has a keen sense of what customers are looking for and how to provide SKUs they can’t find elsewhere.\nIn addition to social media and email marketing, the company runs PPC ad campaigns on Google and works extensively with influencers and loyalty programs to boost sales and build brand recognition. These influencers have become key in driving word-of-mouth advertising for the company and boosting online traffic to its website. The company now averages a hefty 35,880+ unique monthly visits to its website.\nThis is an enormously profitable industry. The global cookware market was valued at $30.59 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow by 7.3% through 2030, with cookware products in very high demand in both the commercial and residential sectors. While most of this company’s revenue comes from Cookware, new categories of knives and kitchen tools are gaining traction among the company’s loyal customer base.\nSince kitchenware remains an evergreen vertical that continues to drive high profits, this company’s advancements in creating appealing new products that competitors don’t offer have given this brand a major advantage.\nThe fact that B2B sales are starting to rival the company’s DTC profits and that the company is making a successful global expansion gives the new owner a potent online store to grow and expand.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a largely absentee-owned eCommerce Brand that offers high-demand products in multiple categories. They have developed a loyal, recurring customer base in its native Ireland. Having enjoyed strong Year-over-Year Growth in the past three years, and having expanded to 550+ products in its assortment, the company has a thriving business model that could easily get replicated across the rest of Europe and in the U.S.\nThe opportunity can be exciting for a US-based eCommerce Brand that is looking for ways to expand into Europe. The company is not liable for a 23% VAT and is well positioned in an already English-speaking population. Plus, the company has a very large number of email subscribers and a solid social media presence that will allow a US based company to simply plug its products into their system and begin selling in days.\nHaving shipped 174,000+ orders in the past three years and built up a loyal customer base, the company now has a 29% Repeat Customer Rate and is getting glowing reviews from those buyers. The company also benefits from exclusive relationships with its top-tier suppliers, who are providing them with popular items in categories that include home essentials, kitchenware, garden tools, beauty and cosmetics, electronics, and outdoor & adventure gear. The products sell for an Average Order Value of $39.\nThe company has developed a Subscription Club that is ready to launch, giving customers access to products at discounted rates. This Subscription Club is expected to boost upsells to its existing customer base and guarantee steady recurring revenues while also enhancing customer loyalty.\nThe company has been able to capitalize on significant growth in the Irish eCommerce market, now projected to increase by 10% through 2028, when revenue will reach $11.3 billion. The absence of an Amazon marketplace in Ireland has opened up major opportunities for domestic eCommerce businesses to market products in high-demand categories without the need to pay import duties or extra fees. With a strong track record in the country and enough SKUs to satisfy public demand, the company is well positioned to continue growing in the Irish eCommerce market – and to expand well beyond the country’s borders.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly by launching an international expansion that replicates the company’s successful formula in other European nations, and in the U.S. The company could also continue launching new products to improve upsells and attract a wider customer demographic.\nValue Propositions\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Customer-Centric Approach.The brand’s customer-centric approach has become the true heart of this business, and one of its biggest selling points. By working to understand what kind of products their customers want, the company now has the ability to adapt quickly to market trends and consumer preferences. By locating products across multiple best-selling categories, the company has become a trusted and reliable store for Irish consumers. Their website is user-friendly and provides buyers with a seamless shopping experience, and they maintain a dedicated customer support team, giving them high ratings for quickly meeting the needs of each buyer.\n2.Excellent Supplier Relationships.The brand maintains exclusive relationships with its suppliers, which include special terms and priority access to top vendors for their SKUs. This has enabled the company to grow its catalog substantially and offer customers a much wider selection of goods than competitors, while also ensuring they do not run out of bestselling items and can continue to offer customers competitive prices. The company maintains a unique operation that is now highly automated, requiring the current owner to work no more than 10 hours per week managing the business. The company now runs smoothly with minimal owner involvement, ideal for a buyer eager to scale the operation.\n3.Vibrant Marketing Plan.The new owner gets a very successful marketing system that was designed to optimize efficiency — and profits. That includes an email database with 141,000+ engaged subscribers who have helped raise the company’s Repeat Customer Rate and given this business a $46 average Lifetime Customer Value. Using targeted email campaigns sent out three times a week, the company now has a 50% open rate, and this campaign has led to repeat purchases thanks to their tailored content and special offers. The company also runs PPC ads on Facebook, Instagram, and Google, and engages in SMS text messaging to reach customers. Along with a blog on the company’s website, this has given the brand 171,400+ unique monthly visitors.\nThe Products\nLaunched 3 years ago, the company has grown very quickly, providing SKUs it knows customers want. While their focus has been on popular niche categories, their strong vendor relationships mean the company can source virtually any product, since they have the flexibility to expand into additional categories based on new trends or shifting market demands.\nAmong their 500+ SKUs, the company has multiple bestsellers and is not reliant on a few products to generate sales. In fact, their top-selling item represents just 3.6% of their profits.\nSales remain vibrant throughout the year, and peak around the holidays. The company is now developing a system to offer products that are in high demand at different seasons throughout the year to ensure solid recurring revenues. The company’s new subscription model is expected to do the same.\nOperations\nThe company uses a Dropshipping model so they do not need to maintain inventory, and the business can be operated remotely from anywhere in the world.\nThe Dropshipping model has ensured fast shipping times and competitive pricing, which is also helping to boost the company’s Repeat Customer Rate.\nThis operational flexibility has enabled the business to be managed remotely with minimal input on a daily basis, ideal for an investor looking for a profitable online business that doesn’t require a lot of oversight. The current owner, who works just 10 hours per week on the business, is assisted by a team of fully trained remote freelancers who oversee customer service, daily operations, and other tasks.\nThe company’s formula for success in Ireland has been refined and perfected, and the company now enjoys the full benefits of a loyal customer base, rising sales, and an efficient operation that brings them repeat buys. Now the business needs an investor eager to replicate this formula across other nations.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents an innovative Ag-Tech Company that is winning over Educators and Governments with its combination of Artificial Intelligence, STEM Learning in the Agricultural Vertical, and a unique hands-on approach to learning that no other platforms can provide, all wrapped up in a SaaS offering that is creating a highly loyal client base of school systems, colleges, labs, and universities that build up their Recurring Revenue model.\nThis Agritech Platform was designed from the ground up by a highly skilled team of scientists that have been iterating in the space for years. With the advance of AI in recent years, the platform has become exciting, powerful, and a learning tool unlike all others. The platform helps facilitate stronger learning opportunities in schools that focus on the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. As STEM learning becomes more popular, this platform makes studies of agriculture technology more engaging for students and has impressed school districts and the municipal governments that fund them.\nThe Power of AI + Software\nAs the software continues to be accepted by schools around the nation, the company now enjoys 52% profit margins with highly sticky users as its reputation for educational excellence grows stronger. Today, the company is seeking a Non-Control investment of 10-15% ownership in the company to fund an expansion into additional schools across the country and to ensure the platform can successfully market itself as an innovative new approach to learning for students heading into the field of agriculture.\nThe significance of this company’s platform to both STEM learning and the Agritech vertical can’t be underestimated. The global Agritech market is now valued at $23.5 billion and projected to grow by 16.5% through 2030, reaching $79.7 billion that year. There is a renewed focus on this industry because an increasing global population has led to higher food demand. Agritech programs help farms produce more food for less cost and manpower.\nThis company has already completed 15 pilot programs at local schools and developed excellent relations with school lobbyists and government agencies overseeing education. The foundation is in place for this unique STEM platform to become universally embraced in schools across the U.S., and across the globe. But the company requires access to capital to begin fulfilling on that promise.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for an investor to become a part-owner and scale it by marketing this platform in publications and on websites devoted to education, STEM learning, agritech, and the farming industry to build stronger brand recognition, and then focus on expanding the platform into schools across the U.S.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business revealed several key value propositions for a buyer looking for a unique technology program operating in two evergreen verticals, Education and Agriculture. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\nThe Company\nThe Executive Team used its experience to develop this AI-powered Curriculum so it would adapt to each student’s learning pace and style, creating a personalized educational experience. Schools and government agencies are embracing this curriculum since it equips students with the knowledge and skills necessary for a successful future in farming or agriculture technology.\nA first-of-its-kind project, educators recognize that it delivers a relevant, effective STEM education to students, enabling them to become problem-solvers in the field of agriculture.\nThis is a truly groundbreaking approach to education providing students with valuable insights into the science of crop cultivation. It also ensures that each student receives an education tailored to their interests and career goals – and that prepares them for future challenges in the rapidly evolving field of agricultural technology.\nAs the company’s platform continues expanding into new classrooms, the business is projecting $20,000,000 Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) by 2027, and a 55% Compound Annual Growth Rate over the next 5 years. For an ambitious investor, this is a massive opportunity to be part of a leading educational platform that could quickly become mainstream across the U.S.",

As a result, the owners endure a light workload of between 10 and 20 hours weekly during these periods. As necessary, contractors are utilized for customer service, and SEO and fulfillment are outsourced.\nSocial Responsibility\nSince 2020, the business has donated toys to a prominent charity to bring joy to children during the holiday season.

The team is proud to support these initiatives and their mission to provide new toys to children in need and spread the holiday spirit, encourages customers to purchase.\nScale Opportunities\nVarious avenues are available for a buyer to pursue.\nEstablishing a physical location using the included real estate in this deal for a return address from Santa or the Easter Bunny can deepen customer engagement and boost sales, adding authenticity and emotional connection.

They introduced Australia’s first all-natural 100% cotton tampons 30 years ago, then, as they grew, went on to launch a line of other popular hygiene products such as sanitary napkins, pant liners, overnight pads, and incontinence range with a 100% cotton coversheet.\nTheir 13 SKUs are manufactured exclusively for them by private label manufacturers in China and in Europe, are produced to their specifications, and sold exclusively under their brand. They can be found in all major supermarkets in Australia, and even some overseas markets, with the brand boasting 15 dedicated wholesale customers. Their customers have proven so loyal to the brand that they have a 100% Repeat Customer Rate, as well as a considerable Average Order Value (AOV) of $40,000.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\nThe company’s status as a well-known, well-trusted brand across Australia means they require little in the ways of advertising efforts. They have social media marketing via Instagram and TikTok that is managed by an outside agency, and they have a SEO campaign on their site that is constantly being updated. This campaign includes a blog that is dedicated to educating women everywhere on important hygiene topics such as menstruation, menopause, post-childbirth troubles, and incontinence.\nThe 3 sellers work in CEO positions and spend 30 hours per week on their responsibilities. Outside of these CEOs, the brand also has employees working in the following capacities:\nThe company is a titan of their market, and have excelled in their positioning, relevance, product integrity, and consumer engagement. If a buyer is interested in developing this veteran any further, they could set about doing so through continued global expansion. There are larger international markets that the brand has yet to tap into, such as the US, which would be immensely profitable if given the proper investment.\nThe feminine hygiene market is a difficult one for companies to break into, with plenty of high barriers to entry and supermarkets often having unforgiving expectations for rates of sales. This acquisition’s ability to not just succeed, but actively thrive in this market, makes them an immensely valuable for a buyer’s portfolio.\nIf you’re interested in learning more about what this brand has to offer, then please contact Website Closers today for more details.",

The company has a wide variety of product offering with products for the home, office, garage, outdoors and vehicles.\nThe company’s products are in high demand, attract repeat buys, and are being sold exclusively by this company at competitive prices. It’s been a winning combination for nearly two decades, enabling the business to market products sold under its brand names, maintain multiple top sellers, and expand to additional sales channels to ensure continued growth.\n\nAsian Sourcing and R&D\nOne of the unique opportunities that this business brings to a potential buyer is sourcing office it built in China where its own employees source products, safeguard against quality issues, and handle overseas logistics to the United States. They also have sourcing agents in place in India and the Philippines. These sourcing agents work closely with their staff in the U.S. to continue to build new products for the company – another massive value driver for any buyer of this company.\nNow that they have 5 brands under management and full R&D system in place, there is no end to what these teams can deliver. With so much experience behind them, they have become adept at learning what customers are looking for, and even as important, what customers don’t like about other brands’ products that are out there, but not meeting quality or functionality standards.\nAmazon.com\nAmazon remains the company’s top-performing platform, representing 55% of the company’s revenue. The company has been awarded the coveted Seller Fulfilled Prime opportunity by Amazon, which allows them to ship products from their 3 managed warehouses while still selling products on the Amazon platform under the Prime Badge. This is a huge cost savings to the company since it no longer has to concern itself with Amazon’s ever-increases FBA cost increases. Currently they only offer 10% of the large product array via FBA.\nCustomers like what they’re getting on Amazon, having given this brand a solid 4.5 – 5-star seller rating on the platform, where they have tens of thousands of solid reviews and an amazing amount of real estate. Gaining the organic search results that they have with their products would be very difficult to surmount given the volume that they ship each day. This sales velocity and smart pricing has allowed them to win the #1 Best Seller Badge for multiple products.\nSelling popular everyday items can be fiercely competitive on a site such as Amazon, but this company has its products manufactured to their specifications, and these items are trademarked. The company has agreements with its suppliers not to sell these specialized items to other businesses, giving them a significant advantage over competitors. The company has grown to a whopping 650+ SKUs, enabling customers to search their store for a wide variety of products that sell at a healthy pace year-round, with many enjoying big spikes in sales because they’re seasonal. For example, the company has a line of snow removal products that are top sellers for them during the winter months.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly by launching an international expansion on Amazon’s foreign platforms, and by continuing to do what it does best: developing new, innovative products that are ideal for attracting new customers and for promoting upsells.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nThere are many value propositions for this business, but the 3 we think are the most important for buyers to consider include:\n\nThe Company\nThis 16-year-old company has put the focus on providing customers with items that are practical, handy, attractive in the home, or useful at the right time of year. Having completed careful research on trends among leading retailers and tradeshows, the company has developed a knack for developing items that customers are attracted to.\nWith an Average Order Value of $53, products are competitively priced, and many of the shipments are conveniently handled by Amazon FBA. The products that are not get quickly shipped from the company’s three regional warehouses.\nTheir sales hum vibrantly throughout the year, with a peak during the holidays. Seasonal items, such as their snow removal products, do well in colder months. In addition to its trademarks, the company also has design patterns on its snow brushes, shovels, and lap desks.\nOperations & Marketing\nWith so many products and high demand for many of them, the company takes full advantage of Amazon shipping and its regional warehouses to provide quick deliveries, while their staff understands the art of providing strong customer service. Adequate inventory levels are always maintained to ensure no orders are delayed and the company can keep up with demand.\nAll products are packaged for Dropshipping by their manufacturer. Once orders are received, the company’s warehouse teams simply apply a shipping label on it for delivery.\nIn addition to the company’s 45 employees, two remote workers are used, and the company outsources its graphic design and video editing. All other daily and administrative tasks are done directly by the company’s workers.\nSales are driven in part by PPC ads on Amazon, and one of the company’s employees oversees applying SEO keywords to their websites and product descriptions.As a result, the company now attracts 1 million unique monthly visitors to its websites around peak sales times.\nAmazon has proven to be an enormously beneficial tool for eCommerce shops, giving their products and services exposure to an audience of more than 200 million Amazon Prime users across the globe.Since millions of consumers shop on Amazon daily and trust the platform for quality products, this company is a reminder of how much Amazon has changed the economic landscape, to the benefit of both shoppers and sellers.\nBalance Sheet Notes\nThis company continues to operate beautifully coming out of COVID; however, some of the supply chain issues from COVID continue to weigh on this business, which is why ownership is seeking a partner with access to capital to help it right size and have sufficient capital to continue to grow to $100M+.\nOne issue the company has is that it invested heavily in inventory during COVID since the demand was high and supply was short. The company requires about $6-$7M in inventory at its current sales levels but has over $20M currently on its books. This poses balance sheet and income statement issues on multiple levels:\n\nSummary\nThis company has an enviable future: it offers unique products that people want, continues to launch new SKUs, has a high 4.5 rating on Amazon, and has the right team in place to continue keeping customers happy. For a buyer, it’s a golden opportunity to take advantage of this company to scale it rapidly.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents an eCommerce Company with over thirty years of industry experience in the arts and crafts niche. During that time, they have skillfully evolved with market trends and expanded sales from a website to Amazon and Etsy, where the brand boasts outstanding reviews and a 5-star average rating.\nThe business now boasts over 1,000 popular SKUs, many of which are manufactured exclusively for it, that appeal to hobbyists, professionals, and educational institutions alike. This has diversified revenue between D2C customers and a growing B2B arm that holds immense scale potential.\nManagement has astutely incorporated educational content via a well-read blog and instructional videos to boost engagement by assisting customers on their journeys of making dolls, beaded necklaces, and other unique projects.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for three important reasons:\nCustomer Acquisition\nDespite performing minimal paid advertising, the brand has consistently exhibited a strong financial performance, demonstrating its appeal in the market and outstanding customer satisfaction. The marketing that is performed is effective and comprises various organic efforts:\nEmail campaigns are frequently sent to a database of devoted customers and boost retention, sales, and brand engagement. More recently, an affiliate program with prominent influencers has proven lucrative and is worth expanding. SEO on the company’s website and blog drives organic search engine traffic, and modest social media efforts now attract an additional 40,000 monthly visitors.\nScale Opportunities\nAside from allocating an advertising budget to boost sales, a buyer can explore various avenues to grow the business.\nRefining email marketing campaigns is a cost-effective method to increase the repeat purchase rate by promoting specials, offering discounts, and keeping the brand front of mind for customers. Expanding the product line is low-hanging fruit and can be marketed similarly, encouraging higher cart values at checkout.\nIntroducing new SKUs in adjacent verticals would not only entice a new prospective customer base but also facilitate increasing the average order value by cross-selling to the loyal existing customer base.\nCollaborations with prominent crafting organizations could further enhance the brand’s credibility and perception as an authority in its niche. Additionally, launching video marketing across social media channels is ideally suited to these types of products.\nProducts, Sales, & Customer Base\nOver the past 30 years, this brand has become synonymous with quality, innovation, and excellent customer service. Subsequently, it has become a significant resource for D2C and B2B clients, including DIY enthusiasts of all levels, professional artists seeking high-quality and exclusive fabrics, and various institutions such as schools, museums, and libraries. Various exclusive lines have also attracted the attention of popular social media influencers with whom the brand is now collaborating.\nThe company’s website drives sales, accounting for 65% of revenue. However, Amazon and Etsy are thriving and contribute 20% and 10% toward the top line, respectively. The remainder is derived from high-volume orders. Management astutely implemented a 30-day invoicing plan, which has attracted B2B clients and is steadily growing.\nProducts remain popular throughout the year since the customer base is so broad. Sales to schools and organizations iron out fluctuations from individual shoppers, who are most active during holidays and between September and March. The typical D2C customer is a female between 35 and 65 in the middle to upper-income bracket. She is passionate about creative DIY projects and seeks premium materials and products.\nThe groundwork has been laid for a motivated owner to grow the company to new heights by injecting enthusiasm, innovation, and marketing efforts into this established operation.",

These designs allow customers to take their trendy water bottles, which are popular on social media and in schools nationwide and personalize them to show off their unique style.\nThe second brand offers products designed with the Mexican American community in mind: a demographic that makes up 11% of the nation’s total population and 62% of its Hispanic populace. By appealing to the cultural identity of a specific ethic group with high-quality products, they have built a dedicated following that generates strong sales figures.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\n1.Strong YOY Growth. The brand has seen healthy year-over-year (YoY) growth in both their top and bottom-line metrics. Their growth is driven by the active markets in which the brands have established themselves, their long-term supplier relationships, and strong profit margins. The diversity of their sales channels and target demographics makes them more resilient and indicates the potential for long-term success and future expansion.\n2.Effective Digital Marketing. The brand’s digital marketing strategies have attracted their target audiences and helped them build their enthusiastic following. They have established a strong online presence through clever social media strategies, which are especially effective given the younger nature of the American Hispanic community. This community is highly responsive and inclined to engage with and purchase from brands they enjoy on these platforms.\nThe water bottle brand has also been well-received, appealing to customers of all ages and allowing for tailored approaches to reach a range of demographics.\n3.Efficient Operations. The business is highly turn-key, with their day-to-day operations being managed by a lean but capable team. Current ownership enjoys a light workload as a result, which a buyer can use to focus on scale opportunities or other initiatives.\nReusable Bottle Brand\nThe brand has several value propositions that give them an edge over their competitors in the industry. They carefully curated each design to create a roster of entirely unique patterns and artwork. Their designs take inspiration from celebrities, themes from popular TV shows, and whimsical pet-centric motifs, which advocate for sustainability while helping customers embrace their personal style.\nSince their launch, management has been committed to ensuring the uttermost quality, ensuring that each product meets their standards. These bottles are designed to be appealing without compromising function or durability and are crafted from top-tier materials. As consumers grow more environmentally conscious and the government implements more eco-friendly initiatives, the brand’s commitment to sustainable practices will continue to give them an edge.\nAnother factor behind their popularity has been their fantastic customer service. The team prides itself on prompt and attentive assistance, whether handling inquiries, providing guidance on product maintenance, or resolving issues. Their dedication to their work boosts their customer satisfaction rate and has given them a respectably low return rate.\nMexican Brand\nThe brand’s founder launched the business out of a sense of pride in his heritage, as he emigrated from Guanajuato, Mexico to the US. The founder took his understanding of the preferences of Mexican Americans and applied it to the brand, sourcing from suppliers in Mexico, Guatemala, and the US.\nThese products are practical while also resonating with ethnic heritage, and include tumblers, handbags, water jugs, blankets, and backpacks. They have cultivated a dedicated audience and are particularly popular among women aged 20 to 40.\nThey have strategically introduced products across a variety of categories on their website, which include apparel, accessories, and home and living. The brand has seen rapid growth, achieving sales of $2.5 million through their website and $350,000+ on Amazon in 2023 alone. They fulfill approximately 155 orders every day.\nThe brand has a significant edge in the market due to being the sole provider of these distinctive items, which they bolster with their commitment to quality and excellent customer service. Their efforts have led to enthusiastic reviews and a healthy financial performance.\nSummary\nBoth brands’ products have become popular as gift items, with the first brand seeing the most demand during summer, the second peaking around occasions like Mother’s Day, and both spiking around Christmas.\nThe company’s team consists of warehouse managers and staff, customer service representatives, and social media specialists. This team efficiently handles their day-to-day operations, reducing ownership’s workload.

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a tremendous opportunity to acquire a 3 Letter Dot Com Domain. This opportunity is extremely rare and will become even more rare as time goes on. All 3-lettered .com domains are already registered. The last one was purchased in 1997. This makes these domains extremely valuable and highly likely to climb in value. Some estimates show that 3-5 letter premium .com domains rise between 10-15% in value every year. There are not many other investments where this holds true.\n3-letter domain names distinctively influence consumers and companies due to their brevity and simplicity. In a world where users are bombarded with information, a short and sweet domain name can make a lasting impression. 3 letters are easy to remember, type, and share, making them ideal for brand recognition and recall.\nNot only is this domain only 3 letters, but the phrase is commonly used millions of times every day and has been in use for decades. This is a highly valuable asset that has the opportunity to continue to grow and prosper simply on its own, like a fine piece of art. Add to that the opportunity to place a number of different kinds of consumer or commercial websites on this domain due to its strategic importance to hundreds of business types, and you end up with an appreciating asset that can become a massive enterprise all its own … and all while it continues to grow in value.\nAny ambitious buyer should recognize the enormous potential of owning this 3-letter dotcom domain. The domain is easy to remember and spell and is already being used by millions of people multiple times per day. Even better, the common, highly familiar nature of this domain name is readily applicable to the needs and branding of a wide variety of top industries. A company operating in virtually any major vertical could easily adapt to this domain name.\nThe domain provides a new owner with instant recognition, a firm position with the ranks of internet elites, and significant investment potential as simple and effective three-letter domains continue to appreciate.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways:\nThere are endless possibilities for how this domain can be used. Since it is an easy to remember 3 letter domain, you could rebrand an already successful business into a much more compact, easy to remember domain, start up a whole new venture (where the value of your company is instantly increased simply due to this domain), or you could just store it for value, like BitCoin, Art, etc. So many opportunities.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents an opportunity for an ambitious investor to acquire two businesses for the price of one. The company operates 2 brands on Amazon that are growing rapidly with the profitable fields of FDA-Approved Medical Devices and Sports/Athletics Equipment, two verticals now growing by leaps and bounds. One of the brands markets a portable device to alleviate neck pain, while the second sells playbook wristbands to help athletes remember their plays out on the field.\nA buyer would be in an enviable position here. Both businesses are profitable, growing at a solid pace, and functioning well on their respective Amazon accounts, ranking well within Amazon’s search algorithm. Both companies also provide strong scale opportunities, although the businesses are different enough that it’s crucial to review them individually.\nNeck Pain Device\nAn original product and one that is fully patented, this device allows buyers to experience relief from neck and back pain at home, out on the road, or anywhere they travel. It has a compact design that makes it easy to transport. The pain is relieved in just 10 minutes daily.\nThe product has been approved and endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration and has served thousands of satisfied customers who are giving it highly enthusiastic feedback and glowing reviews. It remains an affordable solution to a problem that impacts millions of people across the globe. The current owner acquired this business in 2021 from the product’s original inventor, and it markets for $49.99. This device is the only one of its kind, and there is very limited competition from other companies marketing inferior cervical traction devices.\nThe product is sold in the U.S., and they are getting a fast-growing number of B2B buyers on Amazon. Today, 15% of their orders are wholesale, sold to numerous health product distributors and retail customers.\nPlaybook Wristband\nAthletes of all ages, from professionals to kids playing youth sports at school, have an opportunity to increase their chances of winning with this wristband that has three play sheet compartments to hold their game moves. It applies to all sports.\nThis 7-year-old brand has become popular not only with seasoned athletes but also parents who purchase it for their sports-loving kids and teens. Celebrities have used and endorsed the product, giving the site tremendous exposure. This Amazon site markets in the U.S. and Canada and has grown to 27 SKUs.\nWhile sales stay healthy throughout the year, the company enjoys a major surge in February and March during Super Bowl time, and again from August to October when summer training camps for kids are being held.\nWhile both brands have different strengths, together they provide an investor a unique opportunity to secure a strong foothold in the medical devices and sports equipment verticals, both of which are evergreen and highly profitable.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business revealed several key value propositions for a buyer looking for online companies bringing in a profit, growing at a steady pace in strong verticals, and with the ability to scale quickly. We anticipate buyers will recognize that value for 3 important reasons:\n1. Highly Motivated Customers. Both brands attract diverse customers. The neck device brings in buyers from age 30 and up, including many mature consumers coping with neck pain as they age. However, the company also attracts younger buyers working from home and finding more neck and back problems from being stationary in front of a computer. The customers have given the product plenty of 5-star reviews and testified to its effectiveness. The wristbands, on the other hand, are frequently purchased for kids and teens between the ages of 10 and 20, with plenty of sales to youth sports groups.\n2. Automated Business. The current owner works just 5 hours per week on each business, with most of the heavy lifting being done by Amazon. That includes shipments through Fulfillment By Amazon, use of Amazon’s internal marketing, and customer service. Most additional tasks are handled by freelance workers, including managing PPC campaigns on Amazon, wholesale invoicing, and applying SEO keywords to their listings.\n3. Growth Opportunities. Either brand could easily launch a global expansion through Amazon’s foreign platforms, and both products are likely to connect with buyers outside of the U.S. and Canada. The new owner could also open Shopify websites for both brands, use PPC ads on Google to drive traffic to them, and employ an influencer and affiliate marketing campaign to drive sales higher. Both products could also be marketed more frequently to retailers specializing in health care devices or athletics equipment.\nOperations\nThe owner now makes large orders several times a year for the neck device, a small product that doesn’t create major inventory demands. Orders are placed with a manufacturer that has received FDA approval since it produces a medical device.\nSmaller orders are made for the wristbands, usually several times a year, from their supplier. Both brands provide a buyer with an enviably strong foundation and a minimal workload. The wristband company has been experiencing tremendous growth year over year since it launched new SKUs on Amazon. The neck pain device is getting a fast-growing number of B2B buyers on Amazon. Today, 15% of their orders are wholesale.\nThe company has managed its marketing efficiently with a PPC ad campaign on Amazon, along with the use of keywords popular in both verticals in all product descriptions.\nThat leaves plenty of room for scaling both businesses through additional digital marketing. The company has not yet explored social media and email marketing, for example, and the new owner has ample opportunity to introduce both brands to a much wider audience through these proven digital tools.\nSince both businesses provide a buyer with easy and automated operations, this one enables a buyer to quickly assume control and then focus on scaling each one. The current owner is available to assist in the transition to ensure it’s a smooth and profitable one.\nSince both brands operate in highly profitable verticals and are poised for rapid growth, this is a surefire bargain for an investor looking for two highprofit businesses that practically run themselves.",

Current ownership would like to remain on and roll a significant portion of equity (20-40%) as they believe the company has only scratched the surface of scale, and is well on its way to a $100 Million Revenue Company.\nWith the universal appeal of giving customers an enjoyable night’s rest, this brand has developed a strong reputation for high-quality retail mattresses and has employed a strong social media presence across multiple platforms to expand their audience.\nAs sales have expanded and increased rapidly on their $1,800+ Average Order Value, so did their SKUs, with the company now offering 68 branded SKUs and thousands of accessories. They have become a leader in the retail mattress vertical, enjoying sales year-round with no seasonal factors.\nThe company is very unique in that it both manufactures is mattresses in its own Florida-based manufacturing plant, and it sells via eCommerce on its branded website and Amazon. In addition to its own manufacturing, the plant and equipment they have invested in for their own products allows them the ability to manufacture US-made safes for other 3rd party brands. White label mattress and bedding manufacturing is a whole growth opportunity for the business – one that has not been focused on, but one that can be highly lucrative for the brand as it continues to scale. US Made products can charge a premium since there is no lag time on shipping and visiting the plant is very easy.\nThis is a significant and evergreen industry. The global adjustable beds and mattress market was valued at $6.24 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow by 8.8% through 2030. Sales are booming not only to individuals and families, including people buying homes for the first time, but also for commercial use, particularly within the healthcare and hospitality industries.\nThe rising level of consumer comfort with online shopping is also providing new advantages for eCommerce companies that promote something everyone desires, which is a good night’s sleep. That’s particularly true of adjustable beds, which are enjoying increased sales as a fast-growing number of consumers recognize the health benefits of using adjustable beds, including reducing back pain, breathing easier, and having better circulation.\nHaving done an exceptional job building up a loyal customer base for their products, this brand has some lessons to teach on how to tap into the public’s longing for comfort and excellent nighttime support.\nLaunched six years ago, the company has grown to offer 5 models of adjustable beds, 3 lines of mattresses, and a large assortment of accessories with more now being developed. While the company spent 3 years with a trusted and reliable main supplier, they now are fully manufacturing their products in their own production facility.\nThe facility began operations in August 2021 and began producing 25% of their products by the fourth quarter of 2022. That has risen to 35% by early 2023. The factory is where they produce mattresses, toppers, dog beds, pillows, sheets and additional sleep accessories.\nWith sales on both their Shopify website and on Amazon, their manufacturing facility has been critical to maintaining their inventory levels as sales continue rising, with dramatic spikes over the holiday season. This has been essential for the company to maintain Amazon sales velocity and a Best Seller ranking on Amazon within the adjustable beds category.\nThe company sells to a wide cross section of buyers that cuts across age, income and location. They are amid a growing trend among customers who show a preference for adjustable beds or traditional frames. In fact, a lot of the success in this industry is driven by word-of-mouth referrals, where satisfied customers recommend adjustable beds to family members, friends and other associates, and this company certainly has benefitted from that as well.\nThe company has taken a unique and very successful approach to their sales, marketing a feature-rich adjustable bed and then selling the mattress as a bundle – an offer that increases the overall value for the consumer.\nIt worked exactly as intended. The company is making 35+ shipments per day from their warehouse, including 15-20 orders that go through Fulfillment By Amazon. Sales are so strong that new inventory orders are placed weekly among their 10 suppliers.\nWhile the company has effectively used PPC ads on Amazon for years, there are other avenues that have been successful in driving sales. That includes PPC ads on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, and of course on Google.\nTo boost their organic traffic, the company has made strong use of video marketing on sites such as YouTube, Snapchat and TikTok, and email marketing to a hefty database of 7,000+ subscribers. They also maintain a content production calendar for their social media platforms, with posts updated daily.\nSEO has expanded their customer base as well, which includes a backlinking strategy, and affiliate influencers being paid for backlinks.\nThese marketing tools have given the company the kind of exposure they desire, with 45,000+ sessions on their Shopify sites and 72,000+ sessions on Amazon.\nThis brand has clearly put to bed any concerns about their future ability to grow and scale this business. The addition of their own manufacturing facility has dramatically improved their inventory levels and the company is poised to increase profits by expanding their manufacturing operations and diversifying their SKUs. They have the ability to grow to $100M in very short order with the manufacturing capacity already in place to get there. Running out of inventory is not a concern for them – since they own the manufacturing element of the business.\nThe current ownership is interested in remaining with the business while selling a majority share of the company and partnering with the buyer in the future, particularly one who can help grow the company at a faster rate.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a successful eCommerce business based in Ireland. The company identifies popular products and works closely with their trusted supplier to bring them to customers in the country, with no hidden fees or taxes. Their mission is simple: Provide the highest quality products to local Irish buyers, directly from the supplier, and allow customers to buy home essentials products online free of import taxes and nonsensically expensive shipping fees, both of which are a big problem for many online shoppers in Ireland.\nThe business comes packed with 300+ SKUs and enjoys a healthy average order value of $42, with sales peaking in Q4. Management is astutely building systems where they can maintain year-long sales, which will boost numbers significantly.  The website is modern and full of well-shot product photos. Built on Shopify, it is easy to navigate and very user-friendly. The images clearly show the designs, and product descriptions are detailed and insightful. The company strategically attracts visitors through its first-rate SEO content and advertising, and as a result, the website gets robust organic traffic and sees 90,000+ unique visitors each month. In addition, management understands the importance of SEO and takes the necessary steps to increase both rank and conversion rates.\nThe business uses a dropshipping agent who searches for and sources suppliers and factories for a specific product and negotiates the best prices. They have a great relationship with their agent, who is lenient with billing and is always on standby.  The products are shipped directly to the customer by the supplier. The agent arranges for the company logo to be added to the product, and a Thank You card is included inside each order, with a discount code and customer contact details. This service adds a branded feel to the business and enhances the customer experience.\nThe supplier places orders based on sales patterns and mitigates risk normally associated with holding inventory, including warehouse expenses, additional employees, etc. The company gets an invoice from their suppliers approximately every 7-10 days. Their shipping agent is the one that handles product sourcing, fulfillment, and the logistics side of the store, charging a small fee per order.\nThis company’s operation is so simple and easy to learn. Because of its dropshipping model, processes are streamlined to be effective and manageable. The company’s reliable suppliers ship all the orders to the customers directly. In addition, the owners have systemized the business to the point where day-to-day tasks are taken care of by the two employees.\nA Customer Support Agent handles all customer contacts (email and social media only). The company uses Zendesk as their ticketing system, which contains macros for 95% of all queries, lowering the staff’s workload. In addition, there is a concrete customer support system that consists of processes and flow charts that any new hire can be trained on and work at scale. A Shopify VA handles upkeep, improvements, changes, and everything website related. This includes preparing new products and importing them into Shopify, to then be tested with Facebook and Instagram advertising.\nThis social media advertising is managed based on performance metrics, and new products are scheduled. The company uses this technique to test all products until they are not profitable to advertise, and then the campaign is killed on that given product. All their other channels benefit from this primary strategy. For example, Google ads show an impressive 4.92 ROAS, while email marketing, which the company outsourced in May, now accounts for 30% of total revenue. In addition, the company has amassed an impressive list of email subscribers. More than 50,000 email addresses are in their massive database, and those customers faithfully receive newsletters that drive sales and boost web traffic.\nThe owner spends around 20 hours weekly on the business with a focus on:\nThere is a huge opportunity to increase revenue dramatically by adding inventory in Europe and Ireland to reduce product costs and improve the delivery times. This is a limitation for the business currently due to limited capital. However, if more products were tested, there is great potential to scale the business exponentially.\nThe company advertises on social media as a metric to determine product popularity but could easily hire a social media manager to drastically improve their presence on the platforms and use them as a conversion tool as well. The same methodology can be applied to Instagram, TikTok, and other social media channels.\nThis business has the numbers, the financial momentum, the customer base, and the niche products and services that consumers gravitate toward. With eCommerce expertise, this business is a moneymaking machine. The new owner will enjoy tremendous success with this multi-million-dollar opportunity.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a 5-year eCommerce Brand operating in the Protective Footwear Market. They offer a curated selection of 40 work shoes, which are designed for various industries and professional settings such as construction, manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and equestrian sports.\nThese shoes emphasize trusted brands, technical specifications, and valuable features like slip resistance and supportive cushioning, making them ideal for providing safety and comfort to their customers. They have an AOV of $81.79, an 18.28% Repeat Order Rate, and low inventory and cash flow requirements.\nThey source their products through a capable sourcing agent, who is also responsible for handling the company’s inventory and fulfillment. The agent’s warehouse ships 100 to 200 orders per day except for Sunday, with the company utilizing a hybrid model to handle their stock.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Niche Market. One of the most attractive selling points for this business lies in their ability to target the protective and professional footwear industry, which is a niche market with an evergreen demand.\nSafety gear is often a non-negotiable investment for employers and workers, with regulatory frameworks often enforcing the use of protective footwear in hazardous environments. This quality makes the market resilient to economic fluctuations, with strong, persistent demand among workers.\n2.Refined Team. The brand has a highly self-reliant team that operates the entire company. This team includes, but isn’t limited to, multiple customer service agents, bookkeepers, a project/operations manager, and shop manager.\nThe work this team puts in has left current ownership with a modest workload of 10 hours per week, which they spend on management and checking to ensure everything is running smoothly.\nAdditionally, the company’s marketing team is polished enough that a buyer could extract them into a separate company to use across many brands, adding even more value to this deal.\n3.Strong Marketing. Their marketing team’s efficiency has paid off for the brand, with the company having a strong ad campaign that utilizes Google ads, Meta image/video ads, email marketing, and UGC. The brand works with many UGC creators to create their footage, with most creators working with them for around 2 to 4 months. These efforts have led to an average monthly visitor rate between 150,000 and 200,000.\nScale Opportunities\nThe strength of the industry and the streamlined operations that the seller has established puts this company in a great position to scale. While the brand’s marketing campaign is effective, a buyer can enhance it by investing in SEO efforts and building their TikTok marketing to improve their organic traffic flow.\nThey could also strengthen their brand image in their market by improving and expanding their line of branded products. By working with HyperSKU, a buyer would be able to make faster iterations of the company’s shoes, allowing them to hit the same conversion rate as the standard shoes.\nFinally, a buyer could pursue expansion opportunities to access more potential customers. For instance, they could establish an Amazon storefront and use its international platforms to establish consumer bases in other countries. The company already generates sales in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, and the nature of their product would allow them to find a customer base wherever workers need protective shoes.\nConclusion\nThe global industrial protective footwear market is thriving, surpassing $10 billion in revenue in 2023 alone. They have over a terabyte of footage that a buyer could use to market the brand’s products, a Google Ad account and Meta pixel with over 150,000 conversions each, and lean operations that will allow plenty of time to scale. While German fluency would be beneficial, the brand requires no special skills to run.\nAdditionally, this deal has significant seller financing available, making it an attractive option for buyers looking to minimize upfront costs while gaining immediate ownership benefits.",

This exclusivity allows the buyer to adopt a differentiation strategy to reinforce customer loyalty and opens the door to future product line expansions, such as additional lighting options that could bolster the brand’s appeal and drive new revenue.\n2.Significant Growth through International Expansion and Social Media Engagement. With the groundwork already laid for expansion into international markets, the buyer could attempt to capture additional revenue by introducing a UK and EU-compatible version of the nightlight.

This worker isn’t needed if a buyer plans to take operations entirely online, however. Their web hosting and backend updates/changes are handled by Freshysites.\nScale Opportunities\nThe company is well-positioned for growth, having worked to obtain strategic relationships with mountain bike manufacturers.

This low workload will afford a buyer ample time to focus on polishing the business and pursuing scale opportunities.\nMarketing & Scale Opportunities\nThe company generates their traffic through 3 main channels: their word-of-mouth referrals, Craigslist’s ads, and organic traffic through 13 Google business profiles. The simplicity of this marketing campaign will allow a buyer to quickly scale by investing in additional advertising.\nThe brand could explore email marketing to strengthen their ad campaign, as while they have a database of over 44,000 clients, it is currently going untapped. An email marketing campaign would allow them to release segmented campaigns, driving repeat orders and improving their customer retention rate.\nCurrent ownership has identified several other strategies a buyer could use to rapidly boost the brand’s revenue and profitability. For instance, they could start by expanding the platform’s home service categories to include services like Pressure Washing, Pool Cleaning, Tree Trimming, Leaf Blowing, and Snow Shoveling.\nThe B2B self-storage market would also be a promising route to explore. The brand has seen interest from self-storage REIT companies looking to partner with them, as the brand can service all their locations. B2B Last Mile Logistics also offers strong potential, with current ownership already planning to extend services to these companies.\nInternational expansion would be another valuable growth opportunity. By expanding their booking system to customers in Canada or other countries, they could drastically expand their potential client base.\nFinally, by completing the platform’s nearly finished Android and iOS apps, they could improve their client experience by making booking even more convenient.\nThe brand is in a fantastic place to grow, with their market expected to see rapid growth in the US.

The contractors handle key functions such as marketing, affiliate management, logistics, and customer service, providing the flexibility to scale without incurring the overhead costs typically associated with in-house teams.\nThis lean operation extends to a suite of essential software services that automate and optimize various business processes. The brand relies on Shopify for their eCommerce operations, Klaviyo for email marketing, and Everflow for affiliate management. The average order is valued at $99.72 on Shopify and $107.59 on Amazon, showcasing the brand’s strong pricing power in the market.\nScale Opportunities\nThe business is primed for growth through several scalable avenues.

Their reputation as a scientifically validated blue light-blocking eyewear provider, bolstered by endorsements from top sports franchises and prominent health influencers, gives a new owner a solid foundation that would be difficult for competitors to replicate. This credibility drives organic word-of-mouth sales and a strong online presence, reducing the need for extensive advertising spend.\n2.Scalable Operations.Current ownership has streamlined operations by building a robust team of independent contractors who manage marketing, logistics, and customer service. This lean operational model is ideal for a buyer seeking a hands-off business with the scalability to expand globally. With automated systems in place, the buyer can easily integrate new sales channels, products, and partnerships without overhauling the structure.\n3.Untapped Markets and Product Lines.The business is well-positioned for expansion, with opportunities to introduce new products like blue wavelength-calibrated lighting and a more affordable eyewear line to capture price-sensitive customers. Additionally, their established brand relationships with high-profile clients and the potential for increased affiliate partnerships and new Amazon marketplaces provide avenues for exponential growth. This is a valuable acquisition for a buyer looking to leverage a strong brand reputation and scalability for rapid market expansion.",

Their SKUs include one adult product, a three-pack of cut-resistant gloves.\nAmazon has contributed significantly to the company’s success. Launched 7 years ago, the company has grown steadily thanks to the tools that Amazon provides, including fast shipping and customer service through Fulfillment By Amazon, which has enabled the current ownership to work as little as 5 years per week running the company. The company has also been able to rely on Amazon’s internal marketing to put its SKUs in front of customers and has a zero marketing budget.\nWith a $30 Average Order Value, the company enjoys steady sales throughout the year, with peaks during the holidays when their SKUs become popular as gifting items. The company has found its key customer demographics on Amazon, and its buyers have responded enthusiastically, giving their shop a 4.6 Product Rating.\nThis is a highly lucrative industry. The global Kitchenware Market is now valued at $65.23 billion and is projected to grow at a 6.9% rate through 2030. There are numerous reasons for the industry’s growth, including a growing number of consumers who love to cook, and a desire to find unique and specialized products that make preparing meals more enjoyable. Cooking classes for “Tiny Chefs” are also growing in popularity, as more businesses set up programs providing Kids Cooking Classes in schools, at parties and special events, at Cooking Summer Camps, and even online programs. This business has been riding this popular trend.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly. Opportunities include launching digital marketing tools such as PPC ads on Google and Amazon, starting a social media marketing campaign that includes influencer partnerships, and expanding into additional marketplaces.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Streamlined Sourcing.The company’s products are sourced in Asia, and this business has developed a sharp edge over its competitors by having its suppliers manufacture mostly proprietary items that parents can’t find elsewhere and are unlike what other companies are marketing. The current ownership has developed excellent relationships with its suppliers. New orders get placed three times a year, and the suppliers are consistently reliable when it comes to processing them quickly and efficiently. The new owner will benefit immensely from the company’s streamlined logistics. All orders are shipped directly to Amazon’s fulfillment centers, so the company has not needed to invest in either a 3PL or a private warehouse.\n2.Well Executed Concept.The business has created a solid leadership position in the field of kitchenware by directing its products toward a specialized audience. By targeting the Tiny Chef market, the company has quickly become a one-stop shop for high-quality cooking products designed for children. The parents who buy their products love that this company helps promote the joy of cooking and safety in the kitchen and helps cultivate a passion for cooking in their kids. All products were crafted with kid-friendly features and undergo rigorous safety testing designed to exceed industry standards. The company has helped put a lot of children on an exciting culinary journey, and their parents love going along for the ride as they experience the joy of cooking together with their little ones.\n3.Scale Opportunities.Having relied on Amazon’s marketing to boost sales, a new owner has multiple impressive opportunities to grow this business and send profits soaring. That could include adding new product lines such as baking sets, kitchen utensils, and recipe books designed for kids, ideal for upsells and cross-sells to their existing customer base. The new owner could also diversify the sales channel by launching the brand’s first Shopify store while also expanding to new marketplaces such as Walmart, eBay, and Etsy to increase the store’s reach. Social media platforms would be an ideal way to engage with customers, and the company could use those platforms to partner with key bloggers and mom influencers in this fast-growing vertical.\nThe Company\nThis 7-year-old business has enjoyed rapid YoY growth and is now a Trademarked Amazon FBA brand, ideally positioned for strong growth in its niche space. In addition to its unique Kids Knife Set, the company has expanded and launched a series of color schemes for the Kids Cut-Resistant Glove space that no one else sells. All products are sold under the company’s brand name.\nThe Kids Cooking Space has been a fast-growing category, made even more appealing by the popularity of cable programs such as MasterChef Jr and the Kids Baking Championship, which whet kids’ appetites for the fun they can have mastering dishes in the kitchen. The company maintains a 4.8 Seller Rating on Amazon, where they receive rave reviews from parents who say their SKUs are ideal gifts for their kids.\nThis is a great opportunity for a buyer looking for an Amazon business with solid recurring revenues, a loyal customer base, unique proprietary products, and the ability to scale rapidly.",

        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents two flourishing Amazon eCommerce Brands operating in the high-demand market of office and organizational supplies. Since their establishment in 2018, this company has gained traction with both business and consumer audiences by offering an extensive line of products designed to support organization and productivity, including plastic folders, presentation binders, sheet protectors, planners, calendars, notebooks, and professional art portfolios. The business has successfully positioned themselves as a trusted brand on Amazon.com for providing high-quality, private-label office & organizational supplies, serving a diverse client base through Amazon’s marketplace. Their Amazon Reviews and BSRs are strong and growing, giving buyers the account velocity they need to take this business even beyond the TTM $2M in Discretionary Earnings.\nThe Company\nBuilt on principles of quality and reliability, this business sources products from well-established manufacturers known for supplying respected national brands, ensuring product durability and market competitiveness. With a lineup of over 65 core products, this business capitalizes on consistent customer demand for organizational essentials while maintaining a stellar 100% positive rating over the past 12 months. With an average order value of $14.02, this business focuses on customer loyalty, achieving strong repeat orders for both brands. Operating primarily through Amazon’s FBA, the business provides fast and efficient order fulfillment, effectively meeting customer expectations.\nOperational Infrastructure\nThe company operates with an efficient model where current ownership oversees key strategic initiatives, supported by 7 team members: Business Analyst, Supply Chain and Finance Managers, Graphic Designers, and two PPC managers. Inventory is managed strategically, with suppliers holding goods until needed, allowing the business to maintain steady stock levels with minimal overhead. Operating on a 99.8% Amazon FBA model, this streamlined approach to inventory and order management enables consistent customer satisfaction and smooth operations.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Customer Loyalty.This business has developed a loyal customer base with strong and growing repeat order rates for both brands. This is a significant indicator of customer satisfaction and product demand. This loyalty is rooted in high-quality products that meet a variety of organizational needs, from professional-grade binders to practical planners and calendars. The new owner could email marketing to bring back the old customer. Social media is another avenue the buyer could use to target past customers.\n2.Efficient and Scalable Operations Model.Operated primarily on Amazon’s FBA platform, this business benefits from a highly streamlined fulfillment process with nearly 100% of inventory managed through Amazon. Ownership has established a responsive supply chain with trusted suppliers who manage stock until it is ready for shipment, significantly reducing storage overhead and ensuring inventory availability for peak demand. This infrastructure enables the business to scale easily without the need for additional physical assets, making it a highly attractive model for buyers seeking minimal operational complexity.\n3.Untapped Growth Potential in New Sales Channels and Markets.Although this business has established a strong presence on Amazon, there are significant growth opportunities in expanding into other online marketplaces such as Walmart, Temu, or Shopify. The business is well-positioned to explore wholesale partnerships and international markets, especially given their established private-label brand and quality-driven product lines. These untapped opportunities allow a buyer to increase revenue significantly with minimal additional investment.\nThis business offers a robust foundation with clear paths for growth, a low-maintenance model, and strong customer retention, making it an ideal opportunity for first-time buyers in the eCommerce sector. This is a business positioned for growth, and understanding the eCommerce space is required to set it on the right part. A buyer can implement some of the growth strategies mentioned here.\nConclusion\nFor a buyer seeking a low-maintenance, scalable investment with a strong foothold in the organizational supplies sector, this business offers an attractive opportunity. With strong supplier relationships, a loyal customer base, and numerous channels for growth, it is well positioned to continue their upward trajectory in the eCommerce marketplace.",

        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents an INC 500 AMAZON AGENCY that helps large brands find a foothold on the Amazon platform. For nearly 6 years, they have offered valuable agency services to clients, such as marketing, brand recognition, listing management, supply chain fulfillment, and customer engagement.\nThey have rocketed up the ranks and are now among the TOP 1% of Amazon 3P sellers. Not only that, but they have also been recognized by Inc. magazine as one of the 500 fastest-growing companies in the US.\nTheir rapid growth has allowed the brand to consistently release unique and exclusive product offerings, adding to a catalog that covers a wide number of popular product categories. The variety and quality of their offerings stand out from those of their rivals, attracting the 30 brands they work with that now includes some very large, well-known brands on the Amazon Marketplace.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this Amazon business indicates a major opportunity for a buyer interested in an Amazon-based company, and we believe buyers will recognize that this one has operated very successfully on multiple levels that competitors simply can’t match. We are excited about this company and its clear value for 3 important reasons:\n1.Flexible Business Models.From their inception, the brand has worked to ensure their clients can thrive on Amazon. As no two companies are the same, they handle each client individually to improve their online presence, polish their pricing, and manage logistics. By helping their clients improve their sales and profitability, the agency also sets them up to be a strategic partner in their future growth.\n2.Problem Solving.The agency has recognized the many hurdles that vendors face on Amazon’s Marketplace, and countered them by offering unlimited support, resources, and strategic expertise to their 3P brands. By working with them, their clients can achieve a more sustainable business model than what they would achieve by operating independently.\nAs more online brands are seeking experienced 3P partners to help them navigate Amazon, the brand has flourished, building a strong reputation as a trusted partner for proactive shop management.\n3.Multiple Channels.While Amazon is their primary platform, the brand works with clients across multiple sales channels. Outside of Amazon US, Amazon Canada, and Amazon Mexico, they also help brands on eBay and Walmart. Additionally, the brand sells technology products on Newegg’s Marketplace, diversifying their revenue.\nThe Company\nSince their launch in January 2019, the brand has been reselling products that help their clients excel on Amazon. They offer vendors an Amazon-as-a-Service (AaaS) solution, which allows clients to leave their Amazon sales channel in the hands of experts while they focus on building and scaling their brands.\nThey work with each vendor to develop custom solutions tailored to their brand’s unique challenges. Their pricing is based on the specific profit margin profiles of each manufacturer, as well as their ability to negotiate favorable pricing.\nThe brand was founded to tackle the daily challenges 3P sellers on Amazon face, which often require expert teams to manage as companies grow. These challenges include, but unfortunately aren’t limited to, rising fees, increased competition, margin guarantees, freight allowances, marketing, funding, returns, and penalties.\nThese issues are made worse by Amazon’s unpredictable inventory management, which swings between overstocking and shortages and often causes lost sales, channel conflicts, and price reductions.\nThe agency aims to solve these problems with a full-service, end-to-end approach that improves brand acceleration, and is also available through 2 flexible payment options. The first is their Reseller Program, which has the agency buying products directly from their client to act as their Authorized Strategic 3P Seller. In the second, their Agency Program, clients pay the brand to act as their comprehensive Amazon service partner.\nBoth programs offer clients a wide range of services to help them succeed. These services include logistics, brand management, case management, advertising, price monitoring, industry research, review management, and listing optimization. These services are organized into 5 key divisions: Brand Protection, Supply Chain & Fulfillment, Customer Experience & Back Office, Marketing, and Account Management.\nThough the Reseller Program offers strong growth potential for a buyer, it requires a significant amount of capital to maintain, as the agency purchases the inventory upfront. The agency is contractually protected if the inventory doesn’t sell, but they must still maintain the cash and credit needed to pay these upfront costs.\nOperations and Marketing\nOutside of their standard trademarks, the brand boasts distinct Intellectual Property (IP) that set them apart. They have developed a proprietary system for managing ASINs on Amazon, which has been a tried-and-true method of managing listings. They also own a Dynamic Pricing and Inventory Management Software, which cost $3 million to develop and is unique to them.\nThe brand advertises their services through a multifaceted digital marketing plan that includes PPC ads on their marketplace platforms, content marketing that involves their website’s blog, social media marketing on Facebook and YouTube, podcasts, and email campaigns. A buyer could improve their advertising by implementing enhanced marketing tools, such as an affiliate marketing campaign.\nTheir operations are handled by 72 experienced employees and a Senior Management Team. The team is automated and efficient enough that the agency’s day-to-day operations require no input from the current owner. The team, especially their Senior Managers, are well-versed in how Amazon operates, and know how to drive sales and how shops should be run.\nThey also employ contractors to oversee back-end account management and brand alignment for their brand partners.\nThe light workload the owner enjoys will leave a buyer able to focus on scaling shortly after purchase. The ideal buyer for this brand would have the skills necessary to raise capital for expansion projects, and the ambition to take the agency to the next level of growth.\nThe reason the agency is in search for a suitor is based solely on access to capital. The company’s clients are requesting that they purchase more and more inventory to expand their SKU count with the agency, but the agency has tapped out their available capital with the current client and SKU count. A well-funded buyer with access to capital can take this business to far new heights by opening up the client and SKU count and using the 72-man team to offer professional left services to a much larger audience of large 3P Amazon Sellers. The sky is limit with the property funding.",

        "title": "14 Year Health & Wellness Company | 2 Brands | Proprietary Weight Loss & Detox Formulas | eCommerce & Wholesale Channels | 50% Repeat Business",
        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents a 14-year CPG Company in the Health & Wellness Category. The company operates under 2 brands, one that is focused on B2B Wholesale Customers and one that is focused on DTC eCommerce Sales. The core focus for these brands is a Unique line of Weight Loss & Detox Solutions. And the effectiveness of these products in the eyes of the consumer has proven itself over and over again given the50% Repeat Purchase Ratethe company achieves across the array.\nTheir product roster is made up of proprietary, all-natural, hormone-free products, tapping into an industry that has thrived as customers grow more concerned about keeping healthy while being reluctant to take expensive injectable prescription medicines now on the market that haven’t been in use for a long period of time to determine side effects and long-term effectiveness.\nBoth brands offer useful and highly detailed support materials that assist customers in their weight loss journeys, such as a protocol book, a journal, and a recipe book. The first brand also offers complimentary coaching calls, but the details put into their materials have meant that few need to take advantage of this service.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Quality Products.The company contracts with a US-based lab to produce their products, which use original formulas under private labels. These products are made specifically and only for them and are popular among women between the ages of 40 and 65. These women prefer effective and natural weight loss solutions as opposed to those that use drugs and/or added chemicals, and, as such, turn to this business for their needs.\nThe company’s products, while helpful for immediate weight loss, are also beneficial for long-term weight management through metabolic reset, adding to their appeal. They have an Average Order Value (AOV) of $187 through their D2C storefront, a $650 AOV through their B2B channel, and a highly enthusiastic consumer base that has driven their Repeat Customer Rate of 50%.\n2.Turnkey Operations.The company boasts low-maintenance operations that require only 2 part-time employees to manage. The first worker handles all packaging, most email and coaching call support, and inventory reporting. The second is responsible for lesioning with the digital marketing company the brand works with, overseeing media content, and creating and designing all printed material, among a few other tasks.\nThe company houses and ships 100% of their inventory from a domestic warehouse, in which they stock at least 3 months’ supply of stock. They fulfill orders daily for timely delivery. The polished structure of their operations and inventory management has left current ownership with a workload of about 20 hours, which they spend on administrative work, bookkeeping, and accounting.\n3.Multiple Marketing Methods.The company draws attention to their products through several channels. They work with a digital marketing company to create and manage their Meta, Google, and Microsoft PPC ads, leading to a RoAS between 3.68 to 23.34 depending on platform. The company also occasionally creates blogs that are posted on their site and pushed to current customers through email newsletters and social media.\nThe bulk of their advertising efforts are done through email marketing. Their 11,000+ subscribers are sorted into various lists to receive automated email flows, weekly newsletters, and sales promotional emails. This list is also used for upselling purposes, which adds to their strong Repeat Customer Rate.\nScale Opportunities\nThe company’s D2C brand has recently gone through a rebrand, with the B2B brand soon to follow. This move has put the business in an excellent position to scale with the right buyer at the helm. The new owner could expand both brands’ offerings by expanding into new and existing product categories, which would let the company target more of their customers’ weight loss needs.\nFrom there, the company could make their products accessible to a wider audience and further diversify their revenue by pushing their D2C products into big box stores. Whole Foods and Costco would be promising options for this move, and the company has already had bigger reps contact them for partnerships in the last year.\nAnother tactic a buyer could take would be to improve the company’s marketing campaign. They could increase their ad spend of their current online marketing for their D2C brand, and conduct clinical studies for both brands to gain new marketing material.\nFrom there, they could begin advertising the listed products on their Amazon storefront, utilize radio marketing and SEO opportunities, and conduct B2B marketing to extend their products into med spas and other healthcare settings.\nConclusion\nThis acquisition has built a healthy reputation for themselves in the nearly 15 years since their launch. Their proprietary products have won over a loyal consumer base among individual customers and healthcare providers alike, and their recent revitalization offers a great opportunity for a D2C/B2B savvy buyer to scale from.",

        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents a Dental Marketing Firm that has strove to keep dentists smiling since their launch in 2017. They offer a Dental Website and Marketing platform built specifically with dental practices in mind, with their services including staples such as Website Management, Hosting, SEO, Paid Ad Management, and Social Media Management. They are operating on pure word of mouth alone, with no paid advertising used to drive traffic, which is low hanging fruit for an enterprising entrepreneur to come in and create a smart Sales & Marketing plan to further grow the business … or a new owner could keep the same semi-absentee owner profile as adopted by the current owner and just focus on organic traffic only.\nPricing runs from $99 to $1,199 depending on which package the dental office chooses, with their Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) landing at $872.30/client. They also offer a custom package with multi-location discounts and pricing. Out of the packages offered, the highest tier is their most popular as it offers a complete marketing solution for their clients’ practices.\nThe business operates on significant margins and is seeing tremendous growth. As of today, they see 59% Net Margins and are realizing 63% YoY Net Profit Growth. They see little seasonality throughout the year, outside of a slight decrease between the end of fall and an increase in the new year due to many offices taking time off during the holidays.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Proven System.The brand’s proven and highly intuitive dental marketing system is suited for dental offices’ front offices, serving as both a marketing and productivity solution. This proven system has given them a minimal churn rate of 3 to 4%, with a strong, dedicated client base and high search rankings. The business operates like a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform.\nTheir typical client is a smaller practice with 1 to 2 locations. This client is based in a competitive market but lacks the in-house expertise to get the new patients they need to succeed. They then come to the brand looking for assistance and find it through their complete Advanced Marketing Solution.\n2.Smooth Operations.Over the years, the seller has crafted a system that operates very smoothly while requiring little oversight on his part. He works an average of 10 hours per week, with this time typically being spent on going through emails, strategizing, and following up on website leads. He also regularly meets with the marketing and development teams to perform reviews and assign new tasks as needed.\n3.Long-Term Team.The bulk of the brand’s day-to-day operations are handled by their director of marketing, who handles direct contact with the clients and manages the company’s team of outsourced contractors. This team consists of a front-end developer, two back-end developers, a social media assistant, and a SEO & Paid Ads Consultant, all of whom work for the brand part-time.\nMarketing\nThe company has cultivated a healthy presence for themselves in the dental industry, as shown by their strong search engine ranking for terms such as “custom dental websites” and “custom dental videos”.\nTheir current strategy right now revolves around SEO efforts, which includes a blog they post each month. This blog incorporates semantic keyword list that they have cultivated, fueling their organic growth further. The company also posts on social media channels for LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram.\nScale Opportunities\nThe highly organic nature of their current marketing campaign has left plenty of room for an ad-savvy buyer to scale this company.\nThey could attend as many dental conferences and trade shows as possible, forming valuable connections with dentists who may need their services. They could supplement this with niche paid ad campaigns or ad videos, further developing their online brand presence.\nFrom there, a buyer could take advantage of this fresh wave of interest by releasing more custom products for clients. Not only would these additional services appeal to new clients, but they could also upsell them to their existing consumer base, strengthening their profits and repeat client rate.\nConclusion\nThis acquisition offers a tried-and-true platform to a profitable niche. As the dental marketing industry is highly fragmented, many practices have been eager to find the personalized attention and service that larger companies may not offer, which this brand skillfully offers.\nThey have a great foundation with a loyal client base, a low churn rate, and strong SOPs in place. With new marketing strategies, the brand could see an influx of new clients looking to meet their marketing needs.",

These events would also help them expand the community of vets and first responders around their products, strengthening their brand image and attracting more customers.\nConclusion\nThis deal is dedicated to their craftsmanship, creating unique, high-quality products that appeal to patriots across the nation. The seller believes that, with the right attention and time, the brand could surge to 5 to 10+ million in revenue, and they have many scale opportunities available that could help them reach that point.",

With nearly 20 years of experience, the company has built up a very loyal client base, customers who come to them for Custom Websites that are personalized to meet their unique needs. Many stay around to take advantage of monthly services such as domain hosting and the company’s new website security protections.\nAs their client base has grown, the company’s profits have been steadily increasing. The company’s Average Order Value is now a hefty $3,900. The agency also enjoys an 80% Repeat Customer Rate from satisfied clients who return frequently for additional services, and their clients are their strongest marketing tool. The glowing and highly enthusiastic testimonials and reviews their customers provide have enabled the company to attract new clients without a dedicated marketing budget.\nThe company continues to expand and introduce new services. In addition to its monthly security protections, the company had a successful expansion into marketing for political campaigns, a niche field that is growing rapidly as more political candidates seek out expert web designers who know how to bring eyeballs to their sites.\nOne key advantage for a buyer purchasing this offering is that the agency has received Pre-Approval for financing from the Small Business Administration. The buyer will be able to take advantage of SBA Lending which allows a new owner to purchase this business with as little as 10% down, and then make payments over 10 years at an attractive interest rate.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly. Having relied on customer testimonials, a new owner could use traditional and proven digital marketing tools such as social media and email campaigns to drive sales higher, in addition to launching new services and offering customers a Referral Rewards program to keep them engaged.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Expanding Services.Although this brand has enjoyed strong sales for its custom website designs, the agency continues to offer new services to boost upsells and attract new customers. The new security and monitoring service provides their customers with access to 24/7 surveillance and updates on their content management system, available monthly, and the company has attracted plenty of new clients for the planning and marketing they provide to political campaigns, which includes access to videographers, web developers, graphic designers, social media strategists, and political consultants. These new services are a reminder that after 18 years, the company is capable of successfully finding ways to invent itself, making the agency an invaluable tool to its new and existing clients.\n2.Turnkey Operation.For a full-time business, the current owner often works as little as 15 hours per week, focusing on communicating with clients, troubleshooting, and managing a team of highly skilled and professional contractors. These employees are paid per project and each one has a specialty among the many services this company provides. For a new owner, that means being able to focus on scaling this business rather than managing daily tasks and ongoing projects, and using the contractor model, the company could easily bring on additional contractors once new clients sign up.\n3.Strong Customer Relations.One key to this company’s success has been its commitment to strong customer relations, feedback, and open communication. That’s why the company’s Lifetime Customer Value has increased, with the typical client now spending close to $4,000 on a website and requesting a redesign every four years. Customers appreciate how the company meets each client’s unique challenges and helps them grow their business over time, and they are increasingly requesting the company’s monthly hosting services or submitting requests for new business cards, ads, or flyers. Clients who request far more advanced website packages now have a Lifetime Customer Value of $10,000. This agency has long-term relationships with a lot of their clients, who trust them to deliver high-quality work and have responded by singing their praises online.\nThe Company\nFirst launched in January 2006, the company now provides a wide range of services that include web development, marketing, and branding services, including SEO, graphic design, WordPress website design, and hosting services. Their website design services have traditionally brought in the most revenue, although the company is enjoying fast-rising sales on their political campaigns, which often rely heavily on graphic design work, and digital marketing services that include social media and video marketing and content creation.\nTheir sales remain consistent throughout the year as the agency attracts businesses of different sizes operating in multiple lucrative industries. Sales often peak around the time Americans get their tax returns since the agency gets a rush of small business owners now able to finance new websites or redesigns. To accommodate the needs of their clients, the company offers package deals that include the Ultimate Custom Website with SEO included, and political campaign packages.\nThe company does not have an active digital marketing strategy, which is a major opportunity for a new owner. In addition to customer reviews, the company has relied on an SEO program that optimizes its website. This has boosted organic traffic that is bringing 1,200+ unique monthly visitors to their site.\nEmail newsletters sent out to nearly 1,000 subscribers have also been successful, generating on average around $5,000+ in new business for each new email campaign.\nThat means the company has not yet tapped into PPC ads, social media, affiliate marketing, and other proven digital tools to grow.\nThe new owner of this company inherits their loyal customer base, skilled team of contractors with a track record for building high-quality websites, and expanding services such as political consulting. The company’s well-earned reputation is something a wise investor can build on to send profits skyrocketing, since there are multiple good scale options available to this company.",

        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents a Software Company that has kept their Dentist Clients smiling for over 40 years. They offer a complete Dental Practice Management Software solution, which has been crafted to help dentists handle the business side of their work.\nThey offer a full suite of 17 services plus computer hardware/solutions, training, and support. The brand also recently released their SaaS product, which, unlike their legacy server-based on premise software, is both server and cloud based. The new product also works on mobiles and tablets, providing customers with a convenient and accessible experience.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\n1.Recurring Revenue Model.The brand generates most of their profit through their traditional packaged software, which is run locally on a server at the client’s site, or in a cloud instance. However, they also enjoy steady recurring revenue through their support package, with an average annual contract size of $1,600.\nTheir service contracts are auto renewed on an annual basis, with this system having been in place for over 25 years.\n2.Strong Customer Loyalty.Their product pricing is below market and inflation trends, which, along with the quality of their service, has given them an incredibly loyal client base. Most of their current customers have been with the brand for years, with their average client having been with the brand for 3 decades.\n3.Marketing Opportunities.The brand’s current marketing campaign consists of Google Ads with keywords, social media marketing, SEO, and an email campaign that targets current customers and prospects with newsletters and e-blasts. Their SEO plan includes a blog they post for monthly.\nTheir marketing campaign has room for improvement, and a savvy buyer could rapidly scale the brand by investing in the right advertising strategies.\nOperations\nWhile current ownership has worked 60+ hours per week in the past during product launch or release, their workload now sits at around 30 hours. Their key tasks consist of overseeing the brand’s operations and departments, handling business growth and development, and leading product innovation and development.\nThe company also has a team of full and part-time workers in the following positions:\n• 1 Part-Time Accountant• 1 Full-Time Support Worker• 1 Part-Time Support Worker• 3 Full-Time Development Workers• 2 Full-Time Customer Success/Trainers• 1 Full-Time Technical Support Agent\nThe brand’s marketing is handled by a third-party marketing consultant.\nScale Opportunities\nWith the release of their SaaS product, the brand is in a prime position to scale. A buyer could start by converting past and existing clients to the new model, and, from there, improve the company’s marketing campaign to attract a new wave of fresh customers.\nThey could invest in stronger email marketing campaigns, ramp up their marketing budget to close sales, and attend relevant trade shows. From there, they could outreach to dental service organizations (DSOs) to better target their core audience. A buyer should build out the brand’s sales team, as it has steadily shrunk through retirements.\nFinally, the new owner could also easily increase profits by increasing the pricing of their legacy and current product line.\nConclusion\nThis seasoned acquisition has been trusted by many of their clients for decades, and for good reason. Their services are highly valuable for those in the dental market, and with the brand having finished their tradition to the new SaaS model, they are in an excellent position to expand their client base.",

        "title": "80 Year Old Brand | Massive Range of Parts for Appliances & Equipment | Amazon, eBay, Walmart & Website Sales | Consistent Growth | Full Management Team",
        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents a seasoned B2B and DTC eCommerce brand that has established itself as a leader in the OEM space. Founded 80 years ago as a vacuum repair business, the business adapted with the times, and 20 years ago entered the burgeoning eCommerce space. It has grown immensely and now specializes in providing high-quality replacement parts for home appliances, lawn and gardening equipment, lubricants, filters, and specialty components across multiple categories, earning a stellar reputation over its long history. With a product offering of more than 29,000 SKUs, it supplies a wide range of home and commercial product solutions that are in constant demand across its multiple sales channels. Further, many of these products are recession resistant as they will always be in demand, because if something breaks, it has to be fixed.\nThe Company\nThe company processes approximately 1,350 orders daily (with capacity to handle 8,000 orders per day), translating to around 350,000 orders annually, with a highly efficient system in place to handle this significant volume. The business operates from a 35,000 sq ft warehouse in Johnson County, Kansas, and serves a loyal customer base through various eCommerce platforms like Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Sears, and its own websites. This multi-channel approach ensures a broad market reach, diversified revenue streams, and consistent earnings growth year over year.\nThe company’s success is built on its ability to attract and retain a wide range of customers, a testament to the quality of its products and customer service. With over 10,000 customers placing more than one order in the last 12 months, the company’s strong customer retention rate further boosts its stability and appeal. In 2023 alone, the company sold more than 8,900 unique SKUs, emphasizing both the variety and demand for its products.\nProduct and Market Diversification\nOne of the key strengths of this business is its diversified product portfolio. There is no dependence on any single top-selling SKU, which significantly reduces risk and creates more opportunities for growth. This company has mastered the art of delivering high-quality products across multiple categories, making it an ideal acquisition for a strategic buyer looking to expand their footprint in the OEM and distribution industries. Many of its suppliers are small and have difficulty profitably managing Amazon, Walmart and other spaces. Due to the company’s decades of online expertise with these platforms, it effectively acts as an extremely efficient portal for these smaller companies to have their products selling online.\nScale Opportunities\nFor a buyer looking to scale the business, there are numerous growth opportunities. Expanding into new international markets or increasing the company’s presence on existing eCommerce platforms like Amazon and eBay can significantly boost revenue. Additionally, investing in more private labeling and developing exclusive partnerships with other brands could open new revenue streams. Private label products currently make up 5-10% of total sales. Expanding the private label offerings would quickly drop to the bottom line as these products generally have a higher margin than other OEM parts. Scaling through further acquisition of smaller parts manufacturers would also quickly drive additional growth.\nOperations\nThis turnkey operation is supported by a full management team, including 1 contractor, 8 part-time staff, 12 full-time employees, and a VP/General Manager. The team handles all critical aspects of the business, including digital marketing, accounting, and eCommerce operations, ensuring a smooth transition for a new owner. They have also developed internal product pricing and market scraping software to ensure that all products are priced as advantageously as possible.\nThe buyer can rely on this capable team to maintain business continuity and support growth initiatives. With the team’s extensive knowledge and hands-on experience, any transition will be seamless, allowing the buyer to focus on strategic direction and expansion opportunities rather than day-to-day operational concerns.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are decisive for a buyer looking to get into the OEM space. We are excited about this business for three important reasons:\n1.Operational Efficiency:With a full team of 22 employees in place, including a VP/General Manager and digital marketing experts, this turnkey operation allows the buyer to focus on strategic growth rather than daily operations. The infrastructure is primed for scaling with minimal hands-on involvement.\n2.Established eCommerce Presence:With sales spread across major eCommerce platforms such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart, and its proprietary website, this business enjoys a broad market reach. The company already processes 1,350 orders daily, thanks to efficient logistics. Strategic buyers might consider expanding to additional eCommerce platforms or even exploring international marketplaces to boost revenue further. With a strong existing operational base, scaling through digital channels is a straightforward path to growth.\n3.Scalable Growth and Marketing Opportunities:Currently, management focus has been on efficiency and the bottom line. Converting that focus to increase digital marketing efforts such as SEO, PPC, and social media, the brand’s visibility could increase top line growth as well. Strategic advertising and additional private label branding would drive both customer acquisition and brand loyalty. Investing in a robust marketing strategy, including email campaigns, influencer collaborations, and paid ads, would help increase conversion rates and customer retention. Given the business’s established market presence, even small marketing investments could yield significant returns.",

        "title": "SBA Pre-Qualified eCommerce Company | Amazon FBA & Website Channels | 3 Brands in Portfolio | Health & Personal Wellness | 70% YOY Profit Growth",
        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents an SBA Pre-Qualified eCommerce Business with 3 Brands under management. Products are sourced and designed in-house to reduce competition and increase quality. The current product line is sold in the Health & Household, Personal Safety, and Multitools Categories, and each brand has its own Amazon storefront and separate Shopify websites.\nAs an SBA Pre-Qualified business, a Qualified Buyer can acquire this company for as little as 10% down, amortized over 10 years at industry-leading interest rates. This allows a buyer the opportunity to spend less up front money on debt service, and focus more on growth.\nAmazon has proven to be a very strong platform for the company. A buyer would receive 3 Amazon accounts with healthy sales, as customers on Amazon give the company plenty of glowing 5-Star reviews.\nThe company is growing quickly. Having sold 900,000+ products since first launching, their products have become a favorite around the holiday season, when each one attracts peak sales as popular gift items. At an Average Order Value of $30, the company now processes 10,000+ orders per month during the holidays.\nThe company has developed an SOP and proven system for picking products and categories that are in high demand with consumers and using an in-house design team to build and source the perfect product for the market. Access to this system, the team and the processes used by this business will be an immediate win for a buyer, giving them the opportunity to use the current foundation of the business to create additional products in current and adjacent verticals.\nProfits shot up by 70% in 2023 and were up an additional 22% by July 2024. This business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly by continuing to design and launch new products to expand the customer base further and boost upsells, and by exploring new marketing tools such as video marketing on YouTube, direct sales on social media sites, and B2B co-branding partnerships with other leading retailers in their verticals.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Unique Proprietary Products.Marketing unique, specialized SKUs has been a key to this company’s increased profits, and to their becoming a Best Seller on Amazon. Their branded SKUs face minimal competition but have brought them more than 5,000+ highly enthusiastic reviews from satisfied customers. Their holiday sales remain one of the company’s additional strengths since their products are recognized as great stocking stuffers and gifts for any occasion. The company’s personal alarm has become a key player in this vertical, while their multitool does well in the Hardware Tool space, and a portable toothbrush cleaner is popular with those interested in oral care, and with frequent travelers.\n2.Diverse Marketing.In addition to selling on Amazon and Shopify, this company diversified its sales channels through a successful Affiliates Marketing Campaign that now brings in nearly 20% of the brand’s revenue. With their affiliates given a commission for every sale they make, this has become a solid expansion tool for the company and a creative way to drive sales higher. The company has a smart marketing plan that uses PPC ads on Google and Amazon to attract customers, while their organic traffic is increasing thanks to an SEO program that fully optimizes their Amazon pages and Shopify sites. Each brand has its own social media platforms on Facebook and Instagram, and those posts are helping to bring 143,000+ unique monthly visitors to their sites.\n3.Autopilot Operations.One way that Amazon has proven to be a financial boon for the company is their use of Fulfillment By Amazon, which provides fast shipping and superior customer service. That helped make this a highly automated company, even though they juggle three separate brands. This offering not only provides a new buyer with 3 brands facing minimal competition, but an equally minimal workload. The current owners are largely hands-off, working as little as two hours per week each. Tasks not handled by Amazon are assigned to three part-time employees, while PayPal’s Zoom manages customer reports and inventory management. The current owners focus solely on maintaining inventory levels and managing their contractors.\nThe Company\nFirst launched in 2019, the company is owned by entrepreneurs that own other, now much larger companies. They have allowed this to run on autopilot without much recent work from them. Despite this, it continues to grow and a new owner can take this wonderful foundation and continue to build it by using the design team to build new product lines. The company has a strong and trusted relationship with its supplier, who manufactures these products exclusively for this company. The company stocks 100% of its inventory and typically maintains at least $1 million worth of available products at all times, especially around the busy holiday season.\nWhile the company operates in three distinct verticals, its customers share certain characteristics. Many of the purchases being made on their sites are impulse buys, boosted by the company’s strong brand recognition and glowing reviews. A significant percentage of their buyers report incomes over $100,000, and their Repeat Customer Rate is rising for all three brands.\nThe company has also excelled at video marketing using social influencers who have been able to communicate the value, design excellence, and novelty of their products.\nAs the company’s profits continue to rise, it would be easy to scale this company simply by adding new products to the mix, which the company has demonstrated a talent for. Additional growth tools are readily available, including 200,000+ subscribers in their email database for future email marketing campaigns, and the company could also offer sales on social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. This DTC brand could also begin launching B2B sales to retailers operating in their three verticals.\nAnother benefit for a buyer is that this is a very straightforward business. Anyone with a basic knowledge of how eCommerce in general and Amazon in particular can run – and grow – it. The company’s ability to design innovative products that appeal to a wide customer demographic is a major asset.",

        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents an eCommerce Brand that offers products through its Membership-Based Online Marketplace. The company now enjoys recurring revenues for its catalog of outdoor and indoor goods, gadgets, and electronics, and revenue from the Membership Program is now 30% of its monthly sales, which are increasing so quickly that the company now ships 200+ orders a day\nThe company’s catalog of Home Furnishings and Indoor & Outdoor products has brought them a fast-growing customer base, and at a $40 Average Order Value, they now maintain a solid and growing Repeat Order Rate. As participation in their Membership Program keeps growing, the company has enjoyed 72% earnings growth since 2023.\nA key reason for the healthy sales is the research the brand puts into selecting its laser focused product line. Their products get reviewed and selected by an internal Product Research Team that determines which new items will generate the highest demand from their membership subscribers. Because of the popularity of its catalog, which has increased to 150 SKUs, the company’s Amazon Prime-like membership program has grown substantially.\nThe company likewise benefits from having Google automatically add its product listings to Google Shopping. Running Google Shopping ads has given this brand tremendous exposure and played a significant role in driving sales higher.\nTheir products also have a lower level of competition in the marketplace and include items that customers want but are having a challenging time finding. Thanks to upsells from new products, their Lifetime Customer Value is now $100.

We anticipate buyers will recognize that value for 3 important reasons:\n1.Strong Customer Demographics.Sales have primarily come from women aged 50 and older with above average income, who share an interest in home furnishings and products that make their lives more convenient. Another thing their customers have in common is lots of disposable cash to spend. A rising percentage of their customers is eagerly signing up for the brand’s membership program, which entitles them to 50% off all products on their website. As this program has become better known and embraced by so many of its loyal buyers, membership revenue now makes up a large portion of its recurring revenue and remains steady year-round.\n2.Turnkey Operation.For a buyer, this automated business is a great opportunity to focus on scaling this brand while an experienced and skilled team handles daily tasks. That team includes managers in charge of operations, fulfillment, customer service, and product research, and also includes the team members who review new items as future listings. Because of the work they do, the current ownership has a small workload, usually no more than 5 hours per week, with a focus on uploading new products and monitoring their Google ad campaigns.\n3.Unique Business Model.The company’s sales have been strong thanks to its Research team which has a knack for finding products that people want, and for the membership program that provides convenience and savings to their customer base. As a result, the company enjoys rising recurring revenue, including from repeat buyers. Because the company has a diverse selection of SKUs, some products enjoy higher sales in the summer months, and others are ideally suited for use in winter. That has enabled the company to grow without being reliant on a few SKUs to drive revenue. In addition, many of the company’s products are evergreen and enjoy healthy sales year-round.\nCompany Operations\nFirst launched in 2022, the company has quickly demonstrated great skill in discovering products that quickly attract vibrant sales and bring new customers to their website. The brand has also created a solid foundation for the business to operate under.\nOnce they select new products to add to their catalog, the orders are sent to their supplier, who gets them listed on the website. The supplier also stores inventory for the brand, free of charge, and handles shipping once orders come in. The company also stands out because its packaging is uniquely designed for them.\nThe company has also demonstrated great marketing skills. Their Google ad campaigns continue expanding their customer base, and these fully automated PPC ad spends on Google Shopping include meta ads used to retarget people who visited the website but haven’t yet made a purchase.\nThe company also boosts its organic traffic through carefully chosen keywords on its website and in product descriptions. This has enabled the brand to enjoy high search engine visibility. The company now gets a huge 300,000+ unique monthly visitors to its site, while an email database of 100,000+ subscribers is ideal for future e-newsletters focusing on promotions, special deals, and launching new products.\nWith its high recurring revenue, fast-growing customer base, solid marketing campaign, and viable scale options, a buyer can walk right in and begin growing this business. That growth could include continuing to launch new products since their research team has a proven skill for finding SKUs with plenty of appeal to their customer demographics.",

With nearly a decade of experience in the Health & Wellness sector, this brand has established itself by delivering superior quality textiles infused with the highest-grade copper ions available, significantly outperforming competitors that use copper oxide.\nCopper garments have been reported to help alleviate a wide range of common ailments by drawing away trapped electricity from damaged nerves, potentially reducing pain, inflammation, and discomfort. This scientifically backed approach has led to an impressive product catalog featuring popular compression sleeves, socks, braces, and splints, all designed for maximum therapeutic benefit.\nThe brand operates through Amazon, Walmart, and its own website, with Amazon accounting for the lion’s share of sales. With the company’s strong foothold on Amazon’s FBA program, they maintain efficient operations, low overhead, and highly targeted marketing, contributing to a substantial return on ad spend. The company also offers tremendous growth potential, particularly through expanding DTC (direct-to-consumer) channels on their website, enhancing brand recognition and customer loyalty.\nTheir top-performing products are bolstered by a “PAIN-NO-MORE” guarantee, offering customers the confidence of a pain-free experience or a full refund within 30 days. This high standard of quality stems from the owner’s extensive research, where market trends, competitive analysis, and sales data drive the development of each new product. The company has 11 established products, 14 recent launches, and releases approximately 4 new products every quarter to keep pace with consumer demand.\nThe sourcing process is equally refined. The brand works with top factories to ensure quality control, comparing product samples against market competitors before mass production. A meticulous approach to logistics has also been established, utilizing Fulfilled by Amazon for Amazon orders and third-party logistics for website and Walmart sales. This results in a streamlined process capable of shipping roughly 500 orders daily.\nThe business enjoys year-round sales with minimal seasonality, apart from a slight peak in Q4 due to health-conscious New Year’s resolutions. With an average order value of $22.45 on Amazon, $36.56 on their website, and $16.27 on Walmart, the brand is highly profitable across platforms. The target customer base is diverse, with the majority of buyers being married women over 45 years old.

We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Operational Simplicity.This business is designed for ease of management. With contractors and virtual assistants handling the bulk of operations—including Amazon and Walmart account management, customer service, and logistics—the new owner can focus on scaling and growth without getting bogged down in day-to-day tasks. The current owner spends just 10 hours a week overseeing the business, making it a turnkey opportunity for a strategic buyer looking for operational efficiency.\n2.Established Multi-Channel eCommerce Presence.With 92% of sales driven by Amazon, and additional revenue streams from Walmart and the brand’s website, this company is well-positioned for further growth. The business already benefits from Amazon’s FBA program, providing low overhead and high efficiency. A buyer can scale quickly by expanding direct-to-consumer sales on the website or tapping into international markets, such as Amazon UK and other European platforms. A new owner might decide to increase brand visibility and customer loyalty by investing in digital marketing channels, particularly SEO, and paid ads.\n3.Scalable Product Line with High Demand.The company’s copper-infused compression products tap into the evergreen Health & Wellness market, targeting customers suffering from pain, arthritis, and injury recovery. With established SKUs and new product launches, plus a pipeline of new products each quarter, the product line is built for consistent growth. The company’s robust market research and data-driven approach to product development provide a solid foundation for ongoing innovation and scaling. Buyer might want to adopt expanding the product’s presence on other eCommerce platforms, or creating an exclusive product lines for B2B & DTC, could accelerate growth and profitability.",

Specializing in contract, contract-to-hire, and direct placement services, the agency focuses primarily on the IT sector, serving mid to upper-market organizations.\nTheir impressive track record in the healthcare industry spans two decades, providing staffing solutions to hospitals and healthcare providers. Beyond healthcare, the agency has made significant strides in sectors such as retail, manufacturing, non-profits, local government, airlines, and more. They hold a federal government Cage number, enabling them to support federal contracts, and have previously partnered with the Department of Energy.\nWith a broad national presence, boasting placements in 40 states in the U.S., this agency has untapped growth potential both domestically and internationally. Their established footprint in multiple industries positions them for continued expansion and success in the ever-growing IT staffing market.\nThe Company’s Growth\nThough their average contract values vary greatly based on size and demand from their clients, most clients will start out with one placement and grow over time. Their contract value can start at $100,000 and grow to multi-millions in value, with permanent placements averaging an 18% fee on salaries.\nThe average customer contract length, meanwhile, falls between 6 to 12 months, while many have continually renewed for more than 10 years.

Their contract-to-hire conversion is after 1,000 hours worked.\nScale Opportunities\nThere is potential for substantial growth in this brand’s future, which could be approached with several different tactics. One strategy the buyer should consider would be a strategic expansion of the sales team, as by combining the strengths of their core team with an expanded sales force and enhanced lead generation efforts, they could better position themselves as a dynamic player in the market and more easily capitalize on emerging opportunities and gain a stronger foothold in established markets.\nThe company might also consider other staffing lines, including Accounting and Healthcare, and creating and growing a strong partner community.

        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents a Nutritional Supplement eCommerce Brand that has developed a solid position in the profitable and evergreen Health & Nutrition Field with its proprietary products that are designed to help improve blood pressure, weight, gut health, and more.\nTheir fully trademarked and 100% proprietary products are made with all-natural ingredients and scientifically tested. The company is growing in just about every known industry KPI, including in the glowing reviews customers are touting associated with product efficacy. Not only are those customer testimonials serving as one of the brand’s strongest marketing tools, but they have delivered thousands of monthly subscribers, which continues to grow over time. Thanks to the trust their customers have in their SKUs, the Brand has enjoyed 100% Year-over-Year growth for the past 4 years and expects to get the same result by the end of 2024.\nAll their 11 SKUs are fully branded, and the company is now selling 1,200+ bottles a day. The company has effectively marketed these products on its Amazon storefront, which now makes up 61% of sales, along with its branded website, and more recently on eBay and a TikTok Shop. Their products have developed a reputation for being healthy and pure, backed by case studies on their effectiveness. Customers are becoming more loyal over time, giving the brand 6,200+ active Amazon subscribers and nearly 4,400 on their website. The average length of each subscriber is about 6 months or longer.\nThat loyalty brought their Repeat Customer Rate up to 30%. With an Average Order Value of $56, their Lifetime Customer Value has skyrocketed to a much higher $347, as new customers continue to discover them.\nThis company is operating in an enormously lucrative and evergreen vertical. Sales of health supplements are strong globally, with profits projected to surpass $230 billion by 2027. Most of the world’s population is now or has used nutritional health supplements, which are popular since they’re reasonably priced, readily available at local stores or online, and can be purchased without a prescription.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a Buyer to acquire this company and scale it rapidly by continuing to develop and release new products (the company now has several new supplements in development), launching an Influencer Marketing campaign to build even stronger brand recognition and be expanding to B2B sales targeting wholesale accounts.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Unique Proprietary Products.A significant benefit for the new owner is that these popular SKUs can only be purchased through this company. The brand has built up a tremendous amount of credibility since its scientific studies demonstrated how effective the products would be. Customer testimonials bear that out. With great product ratings boosting this brand, its reputation has gotten stronger, which is driving sales higher. While their products address numerous health issues, the focus has been on blood pressure support, and those SKUs remain their top sellers. The company continues to research and develop new products, introducing one for prostate care that was rolled out last spring. This supplement sold out all 5,000+ units within three weeks of its launch.\n2.Experienced Team in Place.An experienced and professional team now handles daily operations, including a fulfillment manager, two customer service representatives, an email marketer, a web designer, and a packing employee. As a result, the current owner often works no more than 20 hours per week running the business, focusing on managing relations with their suppliers. The company has team meetings once a week and is known for its superior customer service and attention to the needs of its buyers. The new owner can take full advantage of this team’s skill and professionalism to focus on growing the business.\n3.Expanding Sales Channels.While sales started strong on the company’s Shopify website, the decision to expand and open an Amazon shop proved to be a very shrewd and profitable move. Today 61% of the company’s sales are on Amazon, compared to 33% for the Shopify site. That successful expansion encouraged the company to launch new stores on eBay and TikTok, where sales are starting to grow. The company also has the potential to expand into B2B sales and target its SKUs to wholesalers, big box stores, and any other retailer that stocks nutritional supplements. Since supplements remain one of the most popular health products on the market, that’s a major opportunity for the company.\nThe Company\nLaunched in 2019, the company quickly set itself apart from competitors by developing supplements manufactured only after careful research and using natural, everyday ingredients that blend together to lower blood pressure and improve physical health.\nSales quickly picked up on their Shopify site and then took off on Amazon. They now sell 300 products a day on Shopify and 700 a day on Amazon, and sales remain steady year-round and are not impacted by seasonal factors. Buyers who recognize the effectiveness of their products have become loyal subscribers.\nThe company has strong relations with its four third-party manufacturers, and all products are custom formulations made according to their specifications. To keep up with demand, the company maintains 3 months’ worth of inventory at all times and uses Fulfillment By Amazon for fast and convenient shipping.\nMarketing has been one of the company’s major strengths. Sales on Shopify have increased 300%, and on Amazon are growing 10% higher month over month. Their most effective digital marketing tools have included PPC ad campaigns on social media sites such as Facebook and TikTok, posting three educational and informative blogs on their website each week, and having 125,000+ email subscribers and 45,800+ SMS text message subscribers to target. The result is that the company is adding 1,000+ new email & SMS subscribers every day.\nWith supplements remaining in high demand today, this company’s proprietary products are a great example of how to succeed in this profitable vertical. With a loyal customer base, rising subscription rate, and an experienced team in place, the new owner should have no trouble finding creative ways to scale this business quickly.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a 22-year-old, SBA Pre-Qualified eCommerce and Wholesale Brand that has established themselves as a trusted, well-known baby educational products company for both consumers and wholesale customers.\nThis business has received pre-qualification status for an SBA loan through our trusted lending partners, enabling eligible buyers to purchase the company with a minimum down payment of just 10%. The loan offers a 10-year amortization schedule with highly competitive interest rates, providing buyers with the opportunity for a quicker return on investment while benefiting from extended debt management terms—an advantage not typically available with standard commercial acquisition financing.\nThe brand launched in 2003 with their initial line of educational art cards. From there, they gradually designed and released additional products such as swaddle blankets, play mats, alphabet cards, and various wooden toys.\nThey now offer 222 SKUs, which are available across their website, Amazon, Faire, and their wholesale accounts. They have an Average Order Value (AOV) of $80 for their retail channel, an AOV of $350 for wholesale, and a Repeat Customer Rate of 28.12%.\nThe brand stocks 100% of their products at their warehouse in Florida, and they have $800k, or approximately 1 year of inventory, on hand. Much like other eCommerce brands, their sales peak during Q3 and Q4.\nTheir average customer is a well-educated parent of small babies and toddlers, who earns a high income and has an interest in art, education, music, and shopping. This consumer might browse a few times, spend $20 or less on their first purchase, and return 2.3 times, with a Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) of $120.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Proprietary Products.The company designs all their products, and sources them from trusted overseas manufacturers. They have worked with each supplier for several years, proving themselves trustworthy and capable of meeting the company’s specifications. Their products are made exclusively for the company and no others to be sold under their brand.\n2.Environmental Consciousness. Each of the manufacturers the brand works with has been chosen for their adherence to environmental and social standards such as ISO 9000, Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), and Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS). Their natural, sustainable, and ethically made products have been an excellent asset for the company in an increasingly eco-conscious market.\n3.Minimal Owner Involvement. Current ownership spends 20 hours per week on their responsibilities, consisting of accounting, troubleshooting, and coordinating their computer and online services. Sellers are willing to stay on as product designers.\nThe brand has 2 other employees outside of the sellers, with the first overseeing operations and the other handling the brand’s marketing. The minimal owner involvement operations required will offer a buyer ample time to focus on scaling.\nMarketing\nThe company uses a variety of methods to advertise their products. These include social media, affiliate, SEO, and email marketing tactics that utilize the 17,000 active customers in their email database. They also have a keyword-enriched blog and supplement their strategies with Amazon PPC outsourced to an agency. Their campaign has led to an average monthly visitor rate of 10,170 to their website.\nScale Opportunities\nThere are a few ways that an ambitious buyer can scale this industry veteran. One of the most effective strategies they could take would be to improve their existing marketing campaign.\nThey could focus on Meta and/or Google advertising, as currently, all their active advertising is done through Amazon PPC. A buyer could also improve the brand’s social media channels, as the sellers struggled to get their social media marketing off the ground.\nAdditionally, the new owner could re-engage with foreign distributors. In 2021, the sellers decided to stop sending products to foreign distributors due to the high need of inventory and low payment times. By re-engaging with international distributors, a buyer could enjoy diversified revenue and access to a larger pool of potential customers.\nConclusion\nThis seasoned and reputable name in the toys for toddlers market has earned the well-deserved trust of many customers throughout the years. They have a wide variety of products to appeal to invested parents, and with eco-consciousness on the rise, they are in a prime position to scale with the right marketing efforts.\nThe current owners are also open to staying on as product designers post-purchase, allowing a buyer to continue releasing high-quality designs for continued growth.",

        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents a Manufacturer and Retailer of proprietary scented Wax Candles that they create in-house at their factory. The most novel aspect of the candles is that they’re designed to look like delectable desserts with a similar aroma, and the B2B sales have soared as their products have become popular gift-giving items, encouraging retailers to continue purchasing them in bulk orders to keep their buyers happy.\nThe company’s 70+ SKUs, manufactured and shipped from the company’s factory, now sell in bulk at an impressive $30,000 Average Order Value. Their customers include boutique shops, specialty stores and 50+ prominent retailers such as Paper Store, Meijer, and TJX. The candles can be found on the shelves in hundreds of big box stores across the nation. These retailers like what they’re getting, and this company has achieved a phenomenal 100% Repeat Customer Rate.\nThese rising sales have given the company 43% Net Profit margins, and in the past year, sales skyrocketed as the company enjoyed a remarkable 340% year-over-year growth spurt. The company is fully capable of handling increased orders since their factory can mass produce up to 5,000 candles a day at very low production costs.

Sold at retail prices between $10-$20, customers have embraced their SKUs as the ideal gift for any occasion, from birthdays to graduations to Christmas presents. Their candles have been featured prominently on social media, getting nearly 5 million views and thousands of likes, another clear indication of how popular they are.\n2.Expansion Opportunities:The company has taken full advantage of every opportunity for strategic expansion. As orders increased dramatically, the company responded by utilizing PO and Invoice Factoring to keep up with demand. That enabled the company to grow its revenue significantly from $600,000 in 2022 to $2.6 million in 2023. All candles are produced at the company’s factory in Turkey, a highly automated and streamlined process capable of adding supplementary lines with minimal effort to increase their output. At least $100,000 worth of inventory is maintained so 2-3 shipments can be dispatched weekly from the company’s warehouse. A buyer can acquire the factory as part of the deal or purchase from it on favorable payment terms.\n3.Growth Prospects:The current owners are exploring significant growth opportunities that could include opening a DTC sales platform on their website or Amazon, and launching new SKUs for upsells and cross-sells. In 2023, a Kiosk program was introduced to a local shopping mall, and it quickly took off and turned out to be a success. This is a model that could be replicated across the country in hundreds of other high-traffic malls, and the new owner could similarly take advantage of digital marketing tools such as social media and email marketing campaigns, an affiliates collaborative program, and SEO optimization of the website to boost sales considerably.\nThe Company\nWith their standout appearance that customers love and their in-house supply chains that eliminate the need for third-party suppliers, this company now enjoys vibrant sales throughout the year, with profits soaring during special occasions such as Valentine’s Day, Halloween, and Christmas. All products are maintained in stock with short lead times, and no single SKU dominates sales, which is why the company has been able to grow its product line successfully.\nMost operations are handled by the current owner, including product creation, supply chain management, and sales. An experienced team assists in daily operations, including a full-time warehouse and operations manager, a part-time sales manager, and independent sales reps who make presentations on these products to retailers.\nThe company is now in negotiations for a huge number of new agreements with retailers that maintain more than 1,200 stores across the U.S., indicating these specialty SKUs are likely to become an even more prominent fixture in major retail stores in the future.\nThe reason this company’s future potential is so strong is that the groundwork has been laid for it to thrive moving forward, an excellent opportunity for an ambitious buyer looking for a business that produces specialized products.\nThe product demand alone is a strong indication of how quickly this company could grow with a DTC arm and a much more aggressive digital marketing campaign, particularly since specialty candles remain a popular and evergreen industry.",

        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents an opportunity to acquire an online business that has grown significantly through its impressive collection of eCommerce storefronts that all operate in the Women’s Beauty and Apparel Sectors, two very lucrative verticals for that demographic. The company has enjoyed some of its strongest growth since introducing a popular subscription model, which results in 70% margins and a growing LTV.\nThe company’s popular brands include waist-slimming hosiery, undergarments, eyelashes, and eyebrow-shaping tools, all fully trademarked and unique to this business, which has made them popular with their fast-growing and loyal customer base.\nSo has the company’s subscription model, which has become enormously profitable, giving the company steadily increasing recurring revenues, an important consideration for a buyer looking for a business with solid profits and plenty of growth potential. The company now enjoys a 60% front-end subscription conversion rate.\nThe company also operates in a lucrative and evergreen niche vertical. The markets for women’s beauty and undergarment products continue to demonstrate impressive growth, and this company has demonstrated a clear understanding of what its customers are looking for. The company is bringing in $30,000 to $40,000 daily in front-end revenue, with its subscription-based business model contributing significantly to that. Customers pay a monthly fee of $30-$35, which gives them access to perks that include discounts, free shipping, and VIP access to a webpage offering complimentary products. This subscription model is enjoying 70% net margins and the VIP subscriptions are especially appealing to customers.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly by continuing to launch new SKUs for upsells and cross-sells, while also expanding all products onto Amazon. The company has already shifted one of its brands to Amazon, with impressive results.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Strong Product Selection:The company is continuously researching product opportunities that are in the highest demand among their customer demographics to add to their catalog. This has also contributed to their enhanced profitability. This growth has sharply increased the company’s revenue from $500,000 monthly to $1.5 million in the past year. To keep this momentum going, the current owners have refined a process done weekly over the past four years, which focuses on testing products and establishing new stores. Each new store can then get added to the company’s profitable subscription model. All products are sourced from a private supplier this company has a solid and trusted relationship with, and the supplier can procure items from various manufacturers, giving this brand even more appealing SKUs in the future.\n2.Creative Marketing:With 3 million subscribers, the company has a massive email database for marketing upsells, and it also takes full advantage of SMS texting messaging to reach out to its existing customers. The company has also been successful in running paid Facebook and Instagram ads to drive higher volumes of traffic to their websites, as well as to guide customers to their VIP subscription services. The company has been able to expand its customer base by employing a consistent and standardized process for testing and optimizing ads, and they are now getting 170,000 unique monthly visits to the company’s numerous websites. Their marketing plan has been particularly successful in reaching their key customer demographics of women between the ages of 45 and 54.\n3.A Turnkey Operation:The current owners work 10 hours or less each week on the business, primarily focusing on making strategic long-term decisions that include which stores should join the subscription service, adjusting ad campaigns for scalability, and enhancing subscription sign-up rates. The owners also manage the process of weekly product testing, while an experienced and dedicated team manages daily operations through various roles within the company. These employees are eager to remain with a buyer post-acquisition. With this team in place, a new owner can focus on scaling this company and its numerous online stores.\nThe Company\nFrom the start, the company’s strategy has been to curate a collection of DTC products on their websites, building up a customer base with seven leading apparel and cosmetics brands that operate on a “One-Product Store” model.\nThe introduction of a subscription model for these beauty and apparel products has contributed enormously to the company’s success, providing an increasingly larger monthly level of recurring revenue. As their base of subscribers continues to expand, those customers like what they’re getting since the company maintains high retention rates\nThis is giving the company substantial gross profits upfront as the percentage of new subscribers opting into the service keeps growing.\nAt the same time, the company continues researching related products that can be added to their listing array, and the business has an efficient and streamlined operation. The company operates with minimal overhead costs which contributes to their high margin business.\nFor a buyer eager to operate within the lucrative women’s beauty and apparel verticals, this multifaceted company has the ability to grow rapidly in multiple ways. The company recently enjoyed higher profits after launching one of its brands on Amazon, and adding the rest of its listing to the world’s largest online marketplace would be a surefire way to send profits skyrocketing. The company could add additional sales channels such as Walmart and eBay to the mix.",

        "title": "Tech-Enabled eLearning System | Workforce Development Skills | 273% YOY Growth | 95% Subscription Revenue | Zero Ad Spend | 80% Client Retention",
        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents an established and proprietary EdTech Platform with 11 years of experience in developing youth entrepreneurship. As their courses contain useful material not available in traditional curriculums, they are typically sold to governments and schools.\nThe service offerings that contribute most towards their revenue include bulk subscriptions to EdTech and custom programs crafted to increase youth engagement. These account for 95% of their sales and have given the brand a client retention rate of 80%.\nThe young students signed up to their program are taught a trade and how to utilize an eCommerce marketplace, from which they can sell the products they are taught to create.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Organic Marketing.The brand has achieved an impressive year-over-year (YoY) growth rate without the need for any paid marketing. Instead, they rely heavily on relationship marketing through word-of-mouth referrals and city RFPs.\nThey supplement these strategies with press releases that detail the company’s growth and innovation, youth story videos uploaded on YouTube, and business and industry news updates on LinkedIn.\n2.Strong KPIs.The brand’s fantastic margins and healthy cash flow ensure that the new owner will require virtually no working capital, though a buyer will ideally have cash to deploy for scaling purposes. The brand currently has enough runway to last 18 months due to their low overheads.\n3.Valuable Non-Profit.The company possesses a non-profit arm that helps them obtain contracts in the education space. As the technology needed to service contracts is owned by the for-profit holding, any contracts the non-profit receives can be invoiced.\nThis has been a valuable move, leading to contracts already for 2024. The non-profit can also take on certain operating expenses, adding to the health of the for-profit side. The IP is 100% owned by the for-profit arm.\nRevenue Generation\nOver 80% of the company’s contracts are with governments, with the rest being with schools or NGOs. Contracts for services are ongoing and billed annually. The brand primarily generates their revenue through their EdTech subscriptions and transaction fees from their business eCommerce platform.\nThis eCommerce platform results from a popular course that sees students enroll and build their own businesses. The brand’s material is available in 12 languages, making it accessible to a wider global audience.\nStaff & Operations\nCurrent ownership works full-time in a CEO role. Their primary tasks include overseeing the strategy and operations of the platform, as well as staff management and business development. A buyer would ideally already have a place in the ed-tech space. They employ one additional full-time and one part-time employee who work as Head of Business Development and in Community Engagement, respectively. The brand holds a M/WBE in California and New York, which helps them stay competitive for government bids.\nScale Opportunities\nWhile already successful, the company has plenty of scale opportunities available to pursue additional growth and see a rapid return on investment. They could begin by expanding into new cities via RFPs and tapping into various educational ecosystems through partnerships with schools, governments, and NGOs. By demonstrating the platform’s efficacy in entrepreneurship education across diverse settings, they could bolster their reputation and gain access to more consumers than ever.\nThey could implement an active marketing strategy that combines social media, content marketing, and influencer partnerships for a broader outreach. This campaign could help them establish a direct-to-consumer (D2C) channel, further diversifying their revenue streams. They could also optimize the Learning Management System for search engines, which would improve their SEO practices, broaden their visibility and attract educators and students alike with an interest in entrepreneur-focused education.\nThey could further improve their traffic by working with a PR firm, which would help them build positive press coverage to attract educators, policymakers, and partners, improving their credibility.\nThe brand could meet the demand for project-based workforce development by working with organizations to integrate the platform into curricula. This would expedite adoption and offer more students practical entrepreneurial skills than ever. Additionally, they could align with corporate social responsibility initiatives, which could boost revenue and expand their reach through partnerships with socially responsible corporations.\nThey could expand on this by advocating for policy changes that integrate entrepreneurship education into mandated school curricula, which would align with educational and economic priorities and necessitate government collaboration.\nFinally, they could build pathways for students to secure internships post-course completion. This would strengthen the link between education and industry demands, especially in areas with high demand like NYC. The brand could develop these pathways by investing in technology to enhance AI capabilities and fostering industry ties.\nConclusion\nThis seasoned brand has learned many tips and tricks over the last decade, providing the right buyer with an excellent opportunity. The seller is looking for a minority strategic partner for this company, and one interested in helping them rise to new heights.",

        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents a 15-year Digital Marketing Agency offering a wide range of online services designed to help clients drive traffic and boost conversions. Specializing in some of the most needed services for local business owners, the agency provides website design, search engine optimization (SEO), social media content creation, lead generation, as well as PPC management and localized geofencing. Their primary clientele consists of small businesses across the United States.\nWith a solid foundation and a loyal customer base, the business is well-positioned for growth. The agency enjoys consistent, year-round sales with minimal seasonality, largely due to the structure of their contracts. Most agreements are billed monthly, with some billed annually, ensuring a stable and predictable revenue stream. The agency’s average monthly marketing contracts range from $1,000 to $1,500, while website development contracts typically range from $3,000 to $4,000, making this business an attractive opportunity for further scaling and expansion.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Straightforward Marketing Campaign.The agency’s marketing campaign is simple and highly organic, with its core strategies consisting of networking with small business owners, referrals, and social media advertising done on its Facebook and Instagram channels. The agency also maintains a blog on its website dedicated to valuable marketing tips and tricks, encouraging additional organic traffic that could be built upon by the right buyer.\n2.Loyal Client Base.The brand’s client base has proven to be dedicated consumers, with many of their accounts having been with the business for over 1 year. They have built strong relationships with these accounts due to their excellent services, fair pricing, and adaptability to every new product that has come out over the past 16 years. Their clients’ loyalty contributes to the stability of their sales, giving them a solid foundation with which to work.\n3.Polished Team.Rather than hire standard full-time or part-time employees, the brand instead employs a refined team of subcontractors to complete and manage their ongoing projects. Their team is fairly priced, finishes products by deadlines, and is easy to work with while also allowing the business to operate at reduced full-time employee costs.\nOperations\nThe current owner’s responsibilities include managing customer relationships via emails and overseeing all projects (old and new). The owner actively participates in networking events monthly. These events are crucial for forming valuable connections with potential clients and strengthening the agency’s reputation within its target industries.\nKey Methods to Scale\nThe agency operates in a market that is experiencing increasing demand from entrepreneurs worldwide, positioning it ideally for growth. With a dedicated client base already in place, the agency has significant potential to scale by expanding its focus to include new industries and business sectors. This would allow them to reach a broader range of potential clients and tap into new revenue streams.\nOne of the most effective strategies for scaling the brand would be to enhance their own marketing efforts. With the implementation of link-building campaigns and the expansion of their current social media advertising, the agency could strengthen the strong relationships they have cultivated with their clients, boost organic growth, and further solidify their reputation. Investing in SEO through targeted keywords, additional blog posts, and scaling paid advertising on Meta and Google platforms would also be a powerful way to increase visibility and attract new business.\nIn addition to digital marketing, the agency could benefit from exploring opportunities outside the online space. By continuing to network at small business events, such as trade shows for contractors and chiropractors, they could establish a physical presence and foster trust among potential clients. These in-person interactions would allow potential clients to connect with the people behind the brand, creating valuable relationships within the agency’s core demographics. This multifaceted approach would not only broaden the agency’s reach but also reinforce its position as a trusted partner in the industries it serves.\nConclusion\nThis agency had made a name for itself among small businesses since 2009 when it first entered the market. They have consistently performed well throughout the years due to their excellent services, and the work that their team of subcontractors has put in has kept their clients regularly coming back for more. This is also the first time this agency has been offering for sale, making this a valuable opportunity to purchase them directly from their founder.\nThe current owner is interested in facilitating a smooth transitional training period and handoff, which will assist a buyer in quickly learning the ins and outs of their new responsibilities.",

They also identify and utilize emerging keyword trends and label designs when launching new products across their platforms, hastening their profit generation.\nTheir diverse SKU lineup appeals to customers of all demographics and they see consistent sales throughout the year, with their sales peaking from January to March post-holiday season. Current ownership spends 20 hours every week on tasks like sourcing, optimizing listings, managing personnel, inventory, advertising, and content creation, supported by a team of fulfillment managers, customer service agents, and general contractors.\nThe seller is interested in facilitating a smooth transition process, offering comprehensive training for a buyer and potential equity retention to drive future growth.\nThis deal is in a valuable spot within an active industry currently being driven by health consciousness and eCommerce accessibility.

Their profits typically peak in January and in August due to back-to-school sales.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.International Sales.The brand primarily sells to the US and Australia through their branded website, providing them with more potential customers and diversified sales. A buyer could lean into this by launching sales to the European Union and other nations, and further expand by and by launching storefronts on other popular eCommerce storefronts like Amazon, Etsy, and Walmart, as 100% of their sales are currently generated through Shopify.\n2.Efficient Operations.The company enjoys highly efficient and low-cost operations.

Their strategies combined have given the brand up to 600,000+ unique visitors to their website every month.\nScale Opportunities\nMarket expansion is only one of the ways that an enterprising buyer could scale this brand. They could draw more attention to their website through an affiliate program, which would help to attract mom bloggers and influencers who could promote their products in the future.\nIf a buyer chooses to invest in their email marketing campaign, they could use the channel to release newsletters about any new products.

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a 22-year-old eCommerce Brand that has locked down a dedicated customer base of major installation sites like healthcare facilities, power generation facilities, oil refineries, military, and others with their line of security products. They are the sole business in their industry to offer a full lineup of physical security solutions that protect against cyber intrusion, such as USB port blockers, port locks, security screws, and network locks.\nThey have thousands of SKUs for sale, which have been manufactured in a TAA compliant country: a critical factor in ensuring that their products are as secure as possible. Their commitment to quality security has given the brand an Average Order Value (AOV) of $153.20 and stable year-over-year (YoY) growth. They see little seasonality outside of a brief surge at the end of each calendar year as companies look to spend money before the year is over.\n97% of their sales were stored and shipped from their own warehouse in 2023, with 2.9% being handled through a DropShip model. They generally always keep about $600,000 in inventory at their warehouse.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Strong Customer Loyalty.The brand’s in-house concentration has been dedicated to curating a positive customer experience since their launch. This has resulted in a lot of goodwill and loyalty from their client base, and an impressive Repeat Customer Rate of 73%.\nOutside of their commitment to quality customer service, they strengthen their brand/buyer connection through their social media channels. They outsource their social media management to a company in South Carolina, with this company also helping them manage and host their websites. They generate daily blog posts, Facebook posts, and other content. While the brand is more active on Facebook, they also have a limited LinkedIn presence.\n2.Polished Marketing.The brand has been using Google AdWords for their advertising for many years now, with it acting as their key lead generator. During the last 12 months, paid advertising represented just over 73% of their web traffic. Their campaign is complex and meticulously planned out, involving strategies that range from brand focused to driving traffic to a specific product.\nThey also have a SEO plan in place on their websites, with most of their focus regarding their “on page” work having to do with creating relevant content for their site visitors. They incorporate targeted keywords that they believe their customer base will be more likely to use when searching and create natural inbound links for their “off page” work to bring “link juice” to their site. These links come from news organizations and other industry related sites. These tactics have led to them seeing about 107,000 visitors within the last 30 days to their main website.\n3.Simple Operations.The straightforward structure of the brand’s operations has meant that the seller generally doesn’t need to help with goods being received in or being shipped. Their 40-hour workweek is typically spent serving in an advisory role to all the other staff members, press releases, and coordinating the activities of 3rd party service providers, among several other tasks.\nTheir Google AdWords, YouTube optimization, Amazon advertising, blog posts, and other advertising strategies are handled by outside service providers.\nScale Opportunities\nWhile the brand already does an excellent job at making themselves visible to those who look for them, they could target clients who do not know to look for their products. As these clients typically hire outside companies to do security assessments, the brand has a great opportunity for growth by working with these kinds of service companies.\nAdditionally, though the brand does sell in the US, the market is still at an earlier stage. Given that the US market is just over 15 times larger than that of South Korea, their primary region, the brand could see immense growth by investing in a properly funded marketing effort in the US.\nThe brand could make their products accessible to a wider audience by working with new distributors like CDW, SHI, and Insight. They could also begin working with retail stores like Hobby Lobby for stronger B2B sales, with Hobby Lobby being an early adopter of locking solutions for protecting their networks.\nThe brand has strong potential to target customers who have concerns about lost cable connections due to movement and vibration. These customers might work in environments like naval vessels, factories, and military vehicles, and turn to the brand to secure their USB and network cables.\nConclusion\nThis seasoned acquisition occupies a valuable position in the cybersecurity niche and has the potential to thrive if marketed and further expanded in the US and to certain demographics. An enterprising buyer would be the key to the brand’s future success.",

They boast an expansive email database with roughly 6.8 million subs, which they regularly utilize through their email marketing campaign.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Strong Client Base.The agency’s impressive client base gives them several advantages over their competitors.

Their excellent PR experience and service has set them apart in the marketing industry, and they have bolstered their brand image further with their top-notch brand building and consulting.\n3.Growing Advertising Channels.The agency has just started advertising, with their strategies consisting of Google and Facebook ads, cold outreach on social media, and an email marketing campaign that utilizes their sizable subscriber count. These tactics generate roughly 20% of their sales, but the sellers expect that this number will grow with time. They also regularly showcase their case studies, which lets their impressive track record and client base speak for themselves.\nOperations\nThe 2 current owners are responsible for everything from marketing and operating the business, to fulfillment and taking sales calls. They also manage other resellers and partners as well as clients. Outside of ownership, the agency employs three workers in the following roles:\n• Account Manager• Outreach & Marketing• Outreach Specialist/Developer (Virtual Assistant)\nAs the agency is entirely virtual, they require little to no working capital to operate.\nScale Opportunities\nThe agency has found an excellent niche in their industry, which will give the right buyer a strong foundation to build upon. A good starting point would be to employ new staff, both to increase production capability and to take a few responsibilities off the new owner’s shoulders. This could include a dedicated sales team to help improve the agency’s profits.\nThe agency could boost their profits further by polishing their marketing campaign. They could get better copy for their email marketing, scale their cold outreach, and make more funnels with paid ads. They could also improve their organic traffic by creating a blog and posting more actively on social media, as their posts are typically limited to about 1 or 2 every week.\nConclusion\nThis agency provides an excellent foundation for a buyer who knows how to make the most of it. They are a unique acquisition with an impressive client base to work with and could rapidly scale with a strong marketing plan in place.

Their products offer various unique features that protect users during play, such as safety nets. The products collectively have an Average Order Value (AOV) of $330.

One of the foundations behind their success was, and continues to be, their social media skills. They use YouTube video marketing to find and engage with potential customers, with their videos showcasing the fun and excitement their products can bring. Their YouTube Channel has generated over 268,000 views at the time of writing and has played a significant role in the average rate of 200 products they ship out every day.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Solid Brand Identity.The brand has defined themselves as a “fun-for-everyone” company, with their trampolines being marketed as a great family bonding activity. Their products are also useful for parents interested in getting more exercise into the lives of their children and themselves, as trampolines combine fun with physical activity. In an era where children and adults alike are hooked on the internet, games, and phones, many parents have embraced trampolines as an entertaining way to keep their families healthy and active.\nThe positive messages that surround their products has solidified their reputation in the market and among their audience, with many of their customers’ reviews mentioning that they were directed to the brand by family and friends who had made purchases of their own.\n2.Proprietary Products.They have quickly built brand recognition in their niche through their high-quality, aesthetically pleasing SKUs, which feature enhanced safety measures. The company has increased their product roster to 19 SKUs with different sizes, color variations, and pole configurations to suit the preferences of different customers. The brand has consistently worked to improve themselves as they’ve grown with new products and are currently in the process of creating smaller indoor trampolines designed specifically for fitness.\n3.Polished Marketing System.Their Amazon storefront has thrived in part due to the platform’s excellent internal marketing system, which includes PPC ads to effectively target new customers. The brand bolsters their traffic by running ads on Google and have expanded their marketing to include influencer campaigns on Amazon and their Instagram accounts. Some of these influencers are local celebrities, with the company primarily looking to recruit young, fit moms with children aged 5 to 15 to show how beneficial their products are for physical fitness.\nThey generate organic traffic through their SEO-polished website, email marketing that targets their 4,000+ subscribers, and various social media accounts.

The company keeps up to 2 million in their inventory at their 3PL to meet demand and to offer same-day shipping through Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA).\nThe brand sees steady sales throughout the year, with profits peaking during Black Friday, Christmas, and the spring and summer months of March to August. While Amazon has been their most profitable storefront, they also sell from Shopify. Their average customers are typically parents between the ages of 25 to 46, with young mothers praising their trampolines’ improved safety controls as one of the main reasons they bought from the company.\nCurrent ownership spends as little as 10 hours per week on operations, which they primarily spend exploring growth opportunities. The company’s daily operations are managed by their qualified team of full-time employees, which includes an Operations Manager, Branding Manager, Customer Service.\nConclusion\nThe company’s exclusive product line and fantastic brand messaging has launched them up the ranks in their niche, and they are determined to continue meeting customers’ expectations as they grow.

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents an SBA Pre-Qualified Amazon FBA eCommerce Business with 15 years of experience selling online in a diverse range of top categories, such as Clothing, Jewelry, Toys, Baby Care, and Home and Kitchen. Offering 4 separate brands, the company has built up a loyal customer base for consumer goods that buyers want for all their party and celebration needs.\nWith SBA Pre-Qualification, the business has already gone through an initial underwriting process with our lending partners, who have approved this business for a Small Business Administration backed debt facility. This means that a Qualified Buyer could acquire this stable business for as little as 10% down with the balance of the SBA Loan amortized over a 10 year period, all at industry-leading interest rates.\nAmazon.com Operations\nWith nearly 500 SKUs for sale on Amazon, the company has grown impressively over the past decade and is now shipping a whopping 1,300+ orders daily. Their customers have responded very enthusiastically, providing the company with a 4.8 Seller Rating on nearly 100,000+ reviews. This has given the company consistently strong year-over-year growth as the business appeals to an increasingly broad customer base. The company is expanding that base by driving sales higher for dress-up and birthday party items for children, household parties, and items for special occasions for adults.\nThe company has thrived on its Amazon platform, where sales are strong on a $25 Average Order Value … the perfect price point to sell on that platform. The company continues to grow by introducing new designs every year, ideal for keeping their existing customers interested in upsells and cross-sells. Underperforming products are routinely replaced with new ones and the company continues to invest in new product development, in-house.\nThe company has also relied on Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) for fast shipping and first-rate customer service and has branched out to include a presence on Walmart as well.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly by continuing to expand international sales in Canada and Mexico through Amazon’s platforms and continue to expand the number of product categories they sell items in. There are also strong scale options by focusing on the European market. Finally, the company has never really focused on DTC sales from their websites, but this represents a significant opportunity, including pushing the brand on social channels to drive traffic to the websites.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.SBA Pre-Qualified.A qualified buyer has an excellent opportunity to purchase this thriving online business (at full asking price) for as little as 10% down since this company has been prequalified for SBA Lending through our lending partners. Payments to an SBA Loan are amortized over 10 years at attractive rates. Considering this company’s strong profit margins, rising sales, and appealing outlook for the future, this is a major opportunity for a buyer to get into an evergreen and lucrative vertical.\n2.Effective Marketing Campaigns.The company has discovered that PPC ads on Amazon are a highly effective way to drive sales. Their research indicates that customers are loyal to Amazon Prime, even more so than to a specific brand, so the company works to maintain top rankings in their best-selling categories. SEO is also a key aspect of their marketing strategy: their listings are fully optimized for top-performing keywords, and they use high-quality photos to promote them. With plenty of 5 Star ratings from satisfied customers, the company has been able to expand its customer base with a minimal financial investment in its advertising costs\n3.Experienced Team in Place.Daily operations are efficiently managed by an experienced, highly trained team that includes a general and supply chain manager, a head of logistics, a marketing manager, and a photographer. This has enabled the current owner to work as little as two hours per week on the business, often focusing on operational reviews and reviewing financials. The company’s data-driven team of 6 individuals is based in Pakistan and has a strong knowledge of how Amazon operates and how to maximize sales in this marketplace. The team provides 24-hour support that includes monitoring Seller Accounts, optimizing listings, and launching strategic Ad campaigns. The team also manages vendors, SEO, and cost optimization, and oversees removing outdated products that are bringing in low sales. This experienced team, combined with the resources provided by Amazon, has made this a highly turnkey operation.\nThe Company\nInitially launched 15 years ago, the company’s profitability has grown steadily as it has branched out to include four separate brands in the Party Supplies niche. Each brand has a comprehensive selection of products for customers to select.\nThe company has also excelled at its intellectual property, another valuable asset that a buyer receives. That includes the work of an in-house team that designs all products which have been branded by their four trademarks. This proficient team understands the target audience for each separate brand and knows how to optimize all listings to ensure these products become top sellers.\nTheir catalog continues to expand, as the company continuously pushes for products that are in demand and have low competition. The company always maintains nearly 500 products, and this has significantly boosted its brand recognition among customers who have come to rely on them as the go-to platform for all party supplies.\nThe company maintains strong relations with its suppliers. All products are imported from Asia and sent to a domestic 3PL. The products are then sent to Amazon FBA for shipping. To keep up with high demand, the company places large volume orders with its suppliers, which enables the business to take advantage of discounted prices.\nThis is a highly profitable industry. The global Party Supplies market is now valued at $16 billion and is projected to grow by 8.5% to a value of $28.5 billion by 2030. Consumers are allocating more of their disposable income to organizing memorial parties, special events, and social gatherings, and this company with its four trademarked brands has become a leader in this niche vertical.\nWith a large catalog that is constantly updated, plenty of glowing reviews, and a solid marketing plan in place, a new owner can allow the workers now in place to continue overseeing daily operations, while focusing on scaling this business. With the offer of an SBA loan on the table, this becomes an even more appealing opportunity for a buyer.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents an Award-Winning, High Margin, Recurring Revenue Digital Marketing Agency that needs zero ad spend to grow their client base and revenue. Proof can be found in the 40% increase in profit they have enjoyed since 2021.\nThey serve a highly diverse client base that includes local home service businesses and eCommerce businesses alike, and currently have over 45 clients signed up for their services. They offer local and eCommerce marketing options, which consist of staples such as paid social, paid search, light SEO work, creative development, and email & SMS marketing.\nThe agency enjoys high margins and strong recurring revenue, with clients paying month to month for their services. Despite their not locking clients into long term contracts, they have very high client retention rates compared to the rest of the industry, testifying to the quality and effectiveness of their services. Their average client length with the agency is 20.38 months in recent years. Their average contract value for local marketing clients is $2,877 per month, while their average for their eCommerce marketing clients is $5,273 per month.\nThe agency boasts an array of certified marketing partnerships to their name. They are a Meta Business Partner, a Google Premium Partner, Klaviyo Gold Partner, Shopify Partner, and Triple Whale Gold Agency Partner. These qualities add to their appeal for clients searching for a reputable marketing agency to do work with them.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Dedicated Clients.The agency’s staunch client base is the product of their quality services, polished team makeup, and strong industry knowledge that they’ve earned through working in the space for several years. Most agencies focus on the numbers the ad platforms report, which doesn’t always align with profit.\nBy understanding what truly matters to their clients and optimizing their creative process, the brand has earned substantially better retention rates than the industry average. Their clients and stable subscription model have given them Net Profit Margins of 54% and 13.6% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth.\n2.Lightweight Marketing Campaign.The agency generates nearly all their clients from referral sources, with no paid marketing to speak of. These referrals are primarily generated by existing clients, with some additional clients being directed to their services by a CRO partner they have a referral agreement with.They also run some limited social engagement via their personal Twitter accounts that are active in the eCommerce space to increase their organic traffic.\nAdditionally, they have some influencer clients they’ve worked with for experimental promotions in the past, but they rarely tap into them to do so. Many of these clients would likely be willing to run more promotions for the brand in exchange for free month(s) of service.\n3.Optimized Operations.The founders have carefully crafted the agency’s business operations with maximal efficiencies and workflow optimizations, which will likely make the transition process easier on a new owner. Their creative process allows them to pump out new creative content for clients every single week at a low-cost while maintaining quality, and the company themselves can be operated from wherever the buyer pleases through their remote capabilities.\nStaffing\nCurrent ownership is primarily divided between several leadership roles, with these roles consisting of director of paid social, director of paid search, and director of email. The brand employs 3 W2 employees who act as a senior email strategist, an email strategist, and a paid social account manager. They also have 20 long-term contractors spread across the following positions:\n• Paid Social Account Lead• Paid Social Media Buyer• Paid Search Media Buyer• Creative Strategist• Designer• Virtual Assistant• Creative Assistant• Developer• Email Support\nScale Opportunities\nAn ambitious buyer will be pleased to find that this is a highly scalable business, with a few easy opportunities to utilize: the first of which being their price. As the agency’s services are currently underpriced, a buyer can quickly boost their profits simply by having clients pay more for their offerings. They could further increase their profits by diversifying their client base to target new demographics, such as larger businesses.\nBuilding upon the agency’s marketing campaign would be another great method of scaling, given how straightforward their current advertising has been. They could invest in paid marketing, or generate direct sales via email, cold call, and direct mail to the local businesses using their existing track record of success. A buyer could also investigate partnering with their influencer clients to promote their brand on popular social media accounts.\nConclusion\nThe agency has rapidly established themselves as a reliable option for clients in need of strong marketing services. Their success is reflected in the stickiness of their client base and their strong recurring revenue, and the right buyer will find no shortage of growth potential in the foundation that’s been left for them.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a rare Technology Business opportunity with a specialized client base consisting of Municipal Water Departments and other city governments, a very lucrative set of clients that has large budgets from state and local tax revenues.\nThis company helps these government offices follow the mandated rules of U.S. environmental and safe drinking water laws, a crucial need for their agencies. The company has 26+ years of experience producing and printing Consumer Confidence Reports for these agencies, which recognize the value of their work. A whopping 97% of the company’s clients stay with them long-term, and while the company’s average contract is valued at $5,000+, the company’s Lifetime Customer Value is considerably high, at $80,500.\nHaving served more than 500+ clients over the past two decades and handled a stunning 80 million reports, the company benefits tremendously from word-of-mouth referrals and glowing testimonials from satisfied customers who have included directors or superintendents managing water departments across the country. These clients have also included major cities such as Atlantic City, N.J., Decatur, Ill., Providence, R.I., and Beaumont, Texas.\nThe company is also unique in having few if any direct competitors providing a similar mix of copy writing, design, and printing services, combined with a thorough knowledge of federal Safe Drinking Water regulations that municipalities must comply with. This has made the company a leader in this vertical, and with a rock-bottom low churn rate of just 3%, the business continues to maintain its prominent position in this field.\nEven though the company has been in business for almost 3 decades, their customer base still continues to grow by up to 10% annually, not only from client referrals but also direct mail advertising courtesy of a database of 55,000+ email subscribers. Telemarketing has also enabled the company to continue its solid growth patterns in recent years.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly by launching new marketing efforts such as an SEO program on the website, an education blog to expand their customer base, and by hiring a dedicated sales team to contact additional municipal water departments around the country.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 4 core reasons:\n1.Strong Growth Potential.The federal government is giving this agency huge new opportunities. Passage of the Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 mandates that by 2027, all water departments must provide a second CCR each year, rather than the current mandate of a single annual report. By providing two separate CCRs to clients, this company is projecting a minimum 27% boost in revenue, and perhaps considerably higher. The company is also well-positioned to help water departments come into compliance with new rules under the Americans With Disabilities Act, and in providing access to public reports in multiple foreign languages. These are services the company already offers, and with an expert knowledge of federal laws, the company can quickly adapt to any changes in federal rules. The company has already updated its order process system and tracking management system to accommodate the new requirements.\n2.Proprietary Systems.Over the years, the company has developed two proprietary systems that have allowed them to continue to achieve very strong margins. The company is now able to manage thousands of client reports at scale, and prior to the introduction of one of their systems, it would take a graphic designer 5-6 hours to design and layout just a single report design from scratch; now a designer receives a fully laid-out report with the style guide already applied, reducing the total design time to 30 minutes, on average.\n3.Experienced Team in Place.A highly automated business, the current owners work as little as 1.5 hours per week, usually focusing on overseeing their marketing and direct mail schedules, and handling accounting and finances. The company employs a full-time senior project manager who supervises all daily operations, and that includes being responsible for the flow of each project and tracking the activities of 10 contractor employers who work as graphic designers and compliance editors. Because the project manager runs the entire operation with the help of the company’s internal, automated management system, the business successfully meets all project deadlines to their customers’ satisfaction. Testimonials from past clients demonstrate how effectively the company has impressed these customers with the quality of their work.\n4.Recession-Proof Business.Within virtually no direct competition, the business has been able to continue innovating, creating systems and processes that have given the owners a minimal workload while ensuring their clients successfully meet all CCR compliance rules. Because these municipal agencies remain operational even during economic downturns, the company has been able to continue growing its customer base and thriving during even the worst recessions. Municipal water departments have no choice but to deliver a professional CCR each year, which is why agencies always budget for this task, and why the company has a nearly 100% return rate. Because water departments often face persistent staffing challenges, the fact that their workers are stretched too thin is another key reason why they actively seek outsourced solutions.\nThe Company\nFor nearly 30 years, this company has become the compliance guru for hundreds of municipal governments in the U.S., helping these agencies avoid compliance violations and enabling them to deliver 100% compliant Consumer Confidence Reports to the state government. The company offers a “No-Worries” Compliance Guarantee that all reports will always meet state requirements.\nThe company has launched a host of additional services that include handling mailings, foreign language translations, ADA compliance, e-filing, and report hosting on the web. The company’s next step has been exploring the opportunity to introduce an AI component into its report builder application, which could eliminate the need for clients to enter technical information manually and make static reports more dynamic. AI technology could provide this business with hands-off management and the ability to generate a compliant CCR with minimal effort on its part.\nAnother significant benefit for a buyer is that the company has a very detailed Standard Operating Procedures policy in place, covering every step of the production process. This means a buyer is not dependent on the skills that the current owners bring to this business. The process they now have in place can be duplicated by anyone, regardless of their background or skill set.\nToday, more and more municipal governments are establishing business arrangements with private contractors for specialized and high-skill tasks. Doing so has saved their agencies money and given them a higher level of operational efficiency.\nWith this company’s solid customer base, an excellent reputation within the industry, and lack of competition in this specialized vertical, the new owner gets a company ready to be scaled and to become a leader in providing expert services to an unlimited number of government agencies.",

        "title": "SBA Pre-Qualified Digital Marketing Firm for Law Firms | 10 Years Established | 4.5+ Years Client Retention | Minimal Ad Spend | Loyal Customer Base",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a 10-year SBA Pre-Qualified Digital Marketing Agency that has tailored their services specifically for the small law firm niche. They offer a full suite of legal marketing solutions tailored specifically for lawyers and law firms, which help them compete for 1st page rankings of highly competitive keywords in their industry and, in turn, increase their clients base.\n• Their services include online marketing tools such as website design, search engine optimization (SEO), blogging, and live chat implementation.\n• Their Average Order Value (AOV) sits at $2,631 per month, and as most clients stay with the brand for over 4 years, their Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) is a healthy $52,000.\n• Their working capital requirements are minimal, as they are cash flow positive and collect from their clients prior to expenses and services.\nThis acquisition is also SBA Pre-Qualified, which will offer their buyer stronger odds of achieving a quick return on investment (ROI) and rapid growth post-purchase.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Low Ad Spend.The agency’s marketing campaign is incredibly lightweight, as while they invested in Google Ads in the past, they ceased to do so several years ago. They currently rely on email marketing alone to send a monthly newsletter to the 250,000 attorneys in their email database. They also maintain a blog on their website that boosts engagement and encourages curious law firms to check out their website.\n2.Straightforward Operations.The brand’s operations are highly straightforward to operate and require minimal training to run. The current owners spend about 3 to 4 hours per day on their primary tasks, which include writing and adding blogs to websites, monitoring Google Ads, answering emails or questions from clients, social media posting, and manual billing. These operations could be streamlined even further by setting up automatic billing.\n3.Strong Business Model.The brand has established themselves as a trusted name in the marketing industry through their client-centric focus and innovative approach. They have spent the past decade offering personalized marketing strategies, earning them a loyal and diverse client base that trusts them to deliver excellent results.\nTheir foundation proved sturdy enough that they demonstrated resilience and adaptability through the COVID-19 pandemic and were able to implement cost-effective strategies that helped them maintain the high quality of their services.\nScale Opportunities\nThe agency’s simplistic marketing campaign means that an ambitious buyer could quickly begin scaling them by building a stronger advertising plan. They could start by reinstating their Google Ads, and, from there, invest in social media and accompanying videos. The brand could then begin targeting additional industries outside of small attorneys, expanding their pool of potential clients and drawing more attention to their new and old services alike.\nConclusion\nThis acquisition has excelled in their niche, and has, over the course of the last 10 years, differentiated themselves with their excellent service, personalized solutions, and commitment to client satisfaction. A buyer would need no prior education outside of basic WordPress knowledge and an understanding of Google Ads and SEO. Current ownership is also willing to stay onboard for a period as consultants to help facilitate the transition and to help the new owner get accustomed to their role.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a veteran Digital Marketing Agency that has been providing premium services to their clients for 37 years. They offer around 40 services, which includes mobile app development, content management, creative services, website application development, and maintenance. They have a well-earned reputation for fast response times and adaptability, which lets them tackle whatever clients throw at them.\nThese qualities have given them zero client churn, with many of their clients having been with the agency for over 20 years now, and an Average Contract Size of $622.58.\nThe firm primarily serves the Not-for-Profit sector, with clients in that demographic accounting for 90% of their total sales. These clients include Medical Associations, Professional Associations, Trade Organizations, Government Organizations, and Charities. The rest of their sales mix is generated by law firms, which offers them the potential to increase their revenue by further targeting this client base in the future.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Stable Year-Over-Year Profits.Their clients are fiercely loyal, as evidenced by their low churn and high retention rate. This, coupled with the firm’s monthly and annual contract length options, has given them steady year-over-year (YoY) profits.\n2.Strong Organic Traffic.The agency relies heavily on organic traffic to find and attract new clients. Their website features standard SEO practices to boost their search engine ranking, and the rest of their clients are generated exclusively through their glowing word-of-mouth client referrals. A buyer could use this as a springboard to grow the brand by establishing stronger organic marketing tactics, and/or by investing in a paid advertising strategy.\n3.Established Team.Their services are provided by a 5-person team of full-time contractors. This team is familiar with and can execute on every service offering, any piece of software that the agency has developed, and all the clients the agency serves.

Their tasks are made up of the following:• Client communication• Writing cost estimates• Coordinating tasks with developers, designers, and content managers• Business Administration (Payroll, banking, bookkeeping, etc.)\nScale Opportunities\nThere are several notable opportunities that an ambitious new owner can use to scale the agency. While current ownership is already taking steps to grow through the development of their new HOA/Condo Corporation Management software package, which will likely add to their sales mix and extend their appeal among new and existing clients alike. They also regularly add upgrades to their Non-Profit Association Management software package to make it more attractive.\nA buyer could make the most of this new addition by expanding the types of Not-For-Profit clients that can use their services and by growing their professional services sector. The latter strategy will be useful for diversifying their client base and growing the pool of potential consumers that the agency can market to.\nOne of the most effective scale opportunities that can be pursued is an investment in advertising and marketing, as they exclusively gain clients at the moment through organic means. They could start by attending various conferences and trade shows, specifically those in the not-for-profit sector, to publicize their brand among their key demographic and strengthen their reputation.\nThey could also improve their digital presence by investing in a paid marketing plan. If a buyer is interested in improving their organic tactics, they could work on developing their email list for newsletters and promotional purposes, polishing their website’s SEO, and potentially setting up accounts on social media sites to strengthen their client/company relationship.\nConclusion\nThis seasoned veteran of the marketing industry has been offering top-notch service since their launch in 1987, and it shows in their excellent services, loyal client base, and dedication to continually improving and adapting to their clients’ needs. A buyer who knows how to construct a strong marketing plan would be the perfect fit for this acquisition and would be able to easily take this brand to their next stage of growth.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a Full-Service Marketing Firm that has been serving a wide range of clients since 2015. They provide expertise in all dimensions of marketing with a strong focus on growth strategies and tactics for their clients. Their services include web design, search engine marketing, branding, and graphic design. The brand takes a hands-on approach alongside their clients through each step of the marketing process, ensuring that they come away satisfied: something that their respectable 40% Repeat Recurring Revenue rate can attest to.\nThough COVID took a heavy toll on many businesses, this firm has achieved consistent SDE growth post-pandemic, with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 24% since 2020. Their stability is in part due to their highly successful presence in dozens of in-demand service industries, such as doctors, dentists, and municipalities. These recession resistant verticals help ensure that their sales remain stable even if a particular industry dips in profitability.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Organic Marketing Strategy.While the firm ran a content marketing initiative from late 2020 through 2022, they currently don’t maintain an active advertisement effort, paid or otherwise. Instead, they primarily generate traffic through word-of-mouth referrals and inbound leads, which they complement with news posts and announcements on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.\n2.Thriving Industry.The digital advertising market has skyrocketed throughout the last few decades, establishing itself as the dominant advertising medium in 2018 and accounting for over half of ad spend around the world. With the number of internet users doubling in size from 2.3 billion in 2012 to 5.1 billion in 2022, business owners across countless fields and industries have realized just how lucrative digital advertising can be, driving the demand for firms that know how to construct an excellent marketing strategy such as this one.\n3.Qualified Team.The brand’s daily operations are managed by an established, self-directed team, which is led by the experienced leaders they have in place. The work this team puts in has left ownership with a workload that falls anywhere between 10 to 40 hours per week, depending on how busy the firm is and how much time the owner is looking to invest. Their daily tasks consist primarily of staff recruitment, management growth, and planning for the brand’s future.\nScale Opportunities\nOne of the best ways that an ambitious buyer could scale this business would be through their own marketing campaign. Their strong organic traffic has given them significant outbound marketing opportunities, and their 1000+ business-strong subscriber database could be used for email marketing purposes, bolstering their recurring revenue rate. They could also undertake paid marketing on Facebook and other social networks, tapping into a versatile channel that is used by millions of consumers every day.\nA buyer could also leverage their established position of expertise in their key verticals to promote themselves to new potential clients, letting their reputation speak for them. Additionally, they could use their foundation to potentially branch off into new industries and/or new regions, giving them a wider range of clients to attract and strengthening their revenue as a result.\nConclusion\nThis deal presents an excellent opportunity to enter the digital marketing industry, or for a buyer to merge their existing marketing businesses into this one for an even greater market presence. They have nearly 10 years of experience satisfying their customers with their polished services, giving them a loyal consumer base and reputation that a buyer could quickly build upon with the right strategies. Management’s flexible schedule will allow the new owner to better tailor this acquisition to their needs, and as the brand is operating cashflow positive, it’s unlikely that there will be any major working capital requirements to deal with.\nThe CEO or COO would be open to remaining for some time if necessary, which could make the transition process smoother.",

        "title": "23 Year Veteran eCommerce Brand | Samurai Armor & Accessories | 70% Repeat Order Rate |  DTC & Wholesale | $680 AOV | Minimal Ad Spend | Strong Social Media Presence",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents an eCommerce Brand that has, for over 23 years, polished their operations and carved themselves a valued spot in the Samurai Gear and Accessories niche. They distribute traditionally crafted, fully functional, and customized reproduction samurai armor, clothing, and accessories worldwide, providing enthusiasts with quality samurai products outside of Japan. Their 100+ products have attracted a diverse audience, which includes display/collection buyers, martial artists, LARPers, cosplayers, and historical reenactment enthusiasts.\nThe brand doesn’t just cater to individual customers, however. Their customizable reproductions of classic and historic samurai armor have given them a growing client base across various industries worldwide, with their products being featured in museums, restaurants, interior design, and even in movies and television shows due to samurai armor being popular in Hollywood. While this has served as a strong source of advertising for the brand, one of their largest traffic generators has been their glowing word-of-mouth testimonials among fans of samurai armor everywhere.\nAnother factor behind their excellent sales has been their dedication to authenticity and quality craftsmanship. They have worked closely with their supplier network to provide the best possible products to the wide range of clients across industries and applications that they serve. Their dedication to the craft has paid off in the form of a 70% Repeat Customer Rate- a rare statistic for many eCommerce brands- and an Average Order Value (AOV) of $680.\nThe company has been able to tap into a lucrative market through their specialized SKUs, which are sold exclusively under their brand name. As most of their products are custom-made-to-order and designed to the customer’s specifications, they have had a minimal need to stock inventory, saving them time and money on warehousing. Though most of their sales are DTC, a rising 10% of their profits are generated through their wholesale and retail clients.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\n1.Improved Productivity.The brand was recently able to double their production capacity after their main supplier finished constructing their new facility. In the past, the company dealt with possible delays during peak sales times for their made-to-order products, which their manufacturer’s new 6,000-square-foot factory, automated machinery, and additional production manager and workers will help to avoid going forward. Their production capabilities have doubled, allowing the brand to meet orders faster and release new SKUs.\n2.Diverse Catalog.The nature of the brand’s niche means they face little competition as they continue to expand, putting them in the position of being the leading global distributor for customizable and traditionally crafted samurai armor and clothing. Their high-quality products are so well-regarded around the world that they have been featured in recent shows like Shogun on Hulu and Age of Samurai-Battle for Japan on Netlfix, giving them an unparalleled portfolio that keeps more curious consumers looking into the brand as time goes by.\n3.Growth Opportunities.Their supplier’s new facilities have allowed the brand to both meet a higher number of orders and begin rolling out additional SKUs. These new products include an expansion of Chinese and Korean-style armor, a print-on-demand t-shirt line, and new digital artwork that aligns with the mockups their customers have purchased in the past. The brand has also started research on the introduction of new synthetic armor, which very few of their rivals offer. A buyer could easily scale the brand by continuing to build on their product catalog, and by expanding their social media marketing campaigns to draw attention to their new and old SKUs alike.\nThe Company\nSince June of 2001, the brand has spent over 2 decades refining their samurai-centric product portfolio for the best possible results. Their products’ customizability has been a major draw for many of their customers, which they complement with additional accessories and services to help them distinguish themselves from traditional Japanese manufacturers. They have incorporated a highly competitive pricing strategy that lets them stay ahead of the few rivals they have in their niche and keep their customers coming back for more.\nThe brand also maintains exclusive distribution contracts with their suppliers, which prevent them from selling the company’s products to anyone else. 99% of their products are DropShipped by their suppliers directly to their customers, avoiding the need for expensive warehousing and inventory costs. Their sales tend to be consistent throughout the year. The brand requires little to no inventory outside of stocking a few small items in the US for fast and easy shipping. They order new inventory every 3 months.\nOperations and Marketing\nThe brand’s daily operations are managed by a private services firm, with current ownership being responsible for a mere 10% of the workload. Their key responsibilities consist of direct marketing and sales.\nAs the samurai armor community is incredibly tight knit, the positive reputation that the brand has cultivated for themselves has proven to be one of their most valuable assets. Their customers often encourage their friends and peers to purchase from the company, which, in turn, leads to more sales and even more glowing referrals. Their average client is typically a man between the ages of 22 and 62 with finances to spare on this hobby.\nThey have bolstered their flow of organic traffic through an SEO program on their website and active social media accounts that improve customer engagement. Their Facebook account now has a remarkable 31,000+ followers, while their Instagram has over 7,500. They also regularly engage with multiple Facebook fans and community pages that are relevant to their key audience. The brand posts stories every day and videos every week to promote their products and strengthen their bond with their customer base. Their combined marketing strategies bring in an average of 17,000+ unique visitors to their website every month.\nConclusion\nThis deal’s new owner can look forward to a leading position in a thriving niche, steady recurring revenue, and a loyal customer base that’s ripe for future upsells and cross-sells. Their improved production capacity has put them in a great position to expand their catalog and continue growing, and with no serious inventory costs, an ambitious entrepreneur can work to quickly expand the company and their operations.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents an SBA Pre-Qualified eCommerce Retailer that has spent more than a decade as an authorized reseller of high-quality Professional-Grade Hand Tools and Personal Protective Equipment, sourced directly from the manufacturers they represent, and sold with competitive pricing.\nThe company has gone through a rigorous initial underwriting process with our lending partners, which has resulted in SBA Pre-Qualification. This allows Qualified Buyers to acquire this business for as little as 10% down with the balance of the SBA Loan amortized over 10 years.\nSince all their SKUs are sourced in the U.S., the company is able to provide fast delivery speeds and has grown to the point where it can offer customers a very large array of 38,000+ products, with at least 900 among their best sellers. At a solid Average Order Value of $150, the company is doing particularly well with Do-It-Yourself customers who are home enthusiasts, have a home workshop, and make repeat purchases on products that lend themselves to their ongoing hobbies. These customers are also an excellent source of word-of-mouth referrals that have enabled the company to continue its growth trajectory.\nTheir products are diverse enough that the company appeals to a wide section of target industries, including construction, agriculture, aerospace, government, and manufacturing. The company’s tools are sold year-round and not impacted by seasonal factors, although they do have some items, such as their cooling towels and shirts, that enjoy peak sales in the summer months, and jackets and face liners that get higher sales in winter.\nThe company also benefits from diversified sales channels. Amazon now represents 61% of the company’s sales, up from 41% in 2019, while the company’s website was 34% of sales in 2023, and eBay, 5%. The company’s focus in recent years has been on growing its Amazon site, with plans to eventually do the same for its eBay platform.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly by expanding into new markets such as automotive parts, and also by enhancing its presence on social media to include an influencer marketing campaign.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Highly Efficient Operations.The company now ships nearly 200 packages a day and maintains high levels of customer satisfaction because of its fast deliveries. The company has a hybrid inventory model, where they stock their fastest-selling SKUs for quick shipments, and otherwise rely on drop shipping from the manufacturers for other products. The company’s suppliers were strategically chosen because of their capability for quick turnaround time, and this company maintains approximately $100,000 worth of inventory at all times to keep up with demand.\n2.Wide Diversity of Products.The company has taken pride in being able to offer its customers such a diverse and wide range of tools and products that are made in the US and come with lifetime warranties. Having been in operation for more than a decade, they can successfully offer personalized customer service to both suppliers and buyers. Customers have come to rely on this brand for high-quality products and the company’s Repeat Customer Rate has soared to 45% of their revenue as upsells get stronger. The company appeals to DIY customers, designated buyers for other businesses, and business customers that include trade professionals. The company has done exceptionally well at identifying customers who have recurring needs and marketing to them for repeat business.\n3.Vibrant Marketing Plan.The company’s marketing is diverse and includes PPC ads used on Google, social media marketing on Facebook and Instagram, email marketing to a database of 29,000+ subscribers, and an SEO program on their website that includes a blog. The company’s content marketing strategy has been highly effective, giving the company vibrant organic traffic to its website and bringing them 15,200+ unique monthly visitors.\nThe Company\nLaunched in April 2013, the company has developed strong relationships with top brands in the industry as resellers. The company is now in the process of adding new suppliers in the field of automotive tools to open up new markets for them. The company is giving its customers more variety, and a reason to return for upsells.\nThis is also expected to boost sales in another way: by having alternate sources for any given product, the company is not reliant on a single supplier who may reach a point where they’re out of stock on specific items, delaying shipments.\nIt also helps that the new brands are well-recognized within their specific niche vertical.\nWhile the company initially had two websites – one for safety products and the other for tool products – they were merged into a single domain in 2020. During this merger, the company relied more heavily on its Amazon platform to grow sales, but overall, the company’s multiple sales platforms have given them steady year-over-year growth.\nThe company has a decade-long track record of recurring revenue, an impressively large catalog of products, and appeal across multiple customer demographics and top-selling verticals. For a new owner, there are plenty of paths for quickly scaling this business, which knows its audience and how to bring them on board.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents an eCommerce brand for sale that has seen significant growth in the succulent market. Throughout the past 7 years, they have flourished into a well-recognized website and a top organic Google search results and have been featured in numerous publications. Their sales are generated through a diverse lineup of D2C and B2B channels consisting of Shopify, Amazon, Walmart, Google, Faire, and eBay. Shopify and Amazon have been their most successful sites thus far, coming in at 68% and 25% of sales respectively.\nTheir products are sourced domestically from reputable suppliers that the brand has built strong relationships with, which ensure that they are of the highest quality available. These 1,230 products are held in their own California-based warehouse before being sold under their brand name, with the brand shipping approximately 400 orders every day. They see an Average Order Value (AOV) of $25. The warehouse is available to remain in place for long or short term.\nThe brand has 2 peak seasons: spring, between the months of March and May, and the holiday season of November to December. Out of the two, spring has proven to be the most active season for the brand, with their products being purchased more often as Mother’s Day gifts than holiday gifts.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\n1.Subscription-Based Revenue.Their products are available through both one-time sales and numerous subscription options, with the latter generating 20% of the brand’s revenue. These options range from 1 to 4 plants with frequencies of monthly, quarterly semi-annual, or annual. The brand currently has 2,000 active subscribers delighting in their monthly succulents, which has fueled their over 40% Repeat Customer Rate.\n2.Owner Absentee Operated.The company has 12 overseas contractors and 13 domestic employees in place. Their domestic staff consists of 9 packers, 3 pickers, and 1 admin, with 6 working full-time and the rest part-time. Their contractors, meanwhile, are all fulltime, and handle marketing, design, SEO, content, and editing. As this team handles much of the day-to-day operations, ownership works at most 10 hours a week on strategy, goal settings, and product sourcing. All the brand’s employees are willing and able to stay on post-purchase.\n3.Robust Marketing Campaign.They have a multi-faceted marketing campaign that has achieved 15% TACoS, 4x RoAS, and a rate of 288,000 visitors to their website every month. Their strategy utilizes paid ads across Facebook, Amazon, Google, social media, and affiliates to broadcast the brand and boost conversion rates. They also have an email marketing campaign that targets the 186,000 customers subscribed to their email list, and an SEO strategy geared towards dominating the space with plant care guide content that has led to the brand ranking highly on Google search results.\nScale Opportunities\nThere are a few ways in which a buyer could nurture this brand and help them bloom into something more. For instance, a buyer could consider establishing a supply chain outside of California, if not moving the business out of California entirely. This would reduce their staffing, shipping, and warehouse costs, and as there are many suppliers of the same products throughout the US, a more central location could result in much higher margins. They could also transition to a central 3PL service to reduce shipping expenses, depending on buyer preference.\nThe brand could bolster their revenue by expanding their wholesale/B2B channel, with nurseries, offices, and retail stores being promising customers. They could promote a business specific subscription model to target these customers in question, as well.\nConclusion\nSucculents are thriving among consumers as a plant that’s easy for green thumbs and newfound plant parents alike to look after, driving up their popularity and cultivating their demand. This acquisition is in a great position to take advantage of this green market. They are well-established in the succulent niche, have a reliable supplier network, and, with the proper TLC, can blossom into a top brand among individual gardeners and businesses alike.\nThe current owners are happy to support the buyer through the transition process, and as the brand isn’t dependent on the sellers or their personal skill set at this time, the buyer should be able to quickly settle into their new responsibilities.",

As a result, everything this company does, from manufacturing to production to final delivery, produces no C02 emissions, a major contribution to the environment that customers have come to appreciate. This is a key reason, along with the high quality of its products, that sales continue to grow so quickly.\n2.Exclusive Supplier Relationships.A significant benefit this company enjoys is its Exclusive Distribution Agreements with its suppliers, with their main supplier providing them with the lowest available prices, giving this brand a terrific competitive edge that they can pass on to consumers when it comes to pricing. The pricing they pay has also enabled this brand to boost its margins by expanding into new markets, including the U.S. and Canada. Their main supplier only produces products manufactured directly for them, so all products are sold under their brand name. Their supplier also maintains a large production capacity and is capable of ramping up its production for them very quickly.\n3.Easy to Scale Operations.There are clear options for scaling this business. One is to further promote sales opportunities in the U.S. There are huge scale opportunities here and in Canada, where the company is already enjoying rising profits. Along with South Africa, these are three nations where there is massive sales potential and limited competition. The company could also continue to focus on growing its B2B sales to wholesalers and brick-and-mortar retailers in each of the countries they’re now shipping products to, and to expand opportunities for boosting the organic traffic to their website, including through expanded social media marketing and the launch of an influencer marketing campaign on those platforms.\nThe Company\nLaunched 7 years ago, the company has focused from the start on trying to provide this vertical with superior products that enable them to stand out. This approach has worked, with the company maintaining a large customer base with high levels of repeat purchases.\nThe brand continues to diversify its products, which now include wall-mounted wine racks, wine cubes, and traditional wine racks, among others. Their products attract healthy sales throughout the year, with major peaks in the weeks leading up to Father’s Day and Christmas, times when their products have become popular gift items.\nThe company also continues to create new products, with several in the design stage and nearing the point when they can be launched, giving the company major opportunities for upsells and cross-sells to its existing customer base.\nThe company began sales in the UK in December 2021 and has enjoyed impressive growth since then, while its US store opened in April 2021 and has seen a serious uptick in sales since the company increased its PPC ad spend there.\nThe company’s formula for offering superior products with low production costs is definitely maximizing profit margins. This has enabled the brand to dominate every market they have entered since first launching. They are now a recognized industry leader for everything related to Wine Racking.\nTheir digital marketing campaigns have contributed to their growth. While most of their sales have come from their PPC ad campaigns on Google and Facebook, a rising percentage comes from the organic traffic they generate that is bringing 14,700+ unique monthly visitors to their website. That includes 17,000+ followers on Instagram, with regular posts on that site and Facebook, and an informative blog on the company’s website as part of its SEO strategy. The company has also invested $10,000+ in professional photography and videography for future marketing efforts.\nThere is enormous growth potential for this brand, which operates in a specialized vertical where its products stand out for design, high-quality craftsmanship, and sustainability. Having successfully brought in new sales in the UK and US, and having cultivated a growing B2B base, the company is ideally positioned to grow by leaps and bounds under the ownership of an ambitious investor.",

        "title": "Staffing Agency for the Aviation Industry | 20 Years in Business | 400+ Active Clients | 99% Placement Rate | Consistent Sales Growth | High Net Worth Clientele",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a Staffing Agency operating in the enormously profitable field of Aviation, with 20 years of experience providing skilled pilots, flight attendants, and maintenance technicians to flight departments, aircraft manufactures, government agencies, fortune 100/500 companies, management companies, and individual owners of private jets worldwide. This company has served 500+ clients worldwide and has a 99% success rate of placing the most qualified candidates with the clients they serve.\nThe company has been enjoying consistent year-over-year sales growth as the Private Aviation Industry has been growing by leaps and bounds. The company caters to private jet owners with very high net worth, and their clients also include Fortune 100/500 companies, financial institutions, and aircraft manufacturers.\nThe company also benefits from enormous growth in the temporary labor market as the need within the aviation industry is particularly severe, with the aviation industry needing an estimated 650,000 new pilots and a similar amount of new aviation technicians over the next 20 years. There remains an increased need for temporary labor due to the ongoing pilot shortage, which is projected to last into the foreseeable future. Fortunately, this company has a history that spans two decades, with an impeccable reputation for attracting and retaining qualified pilots with a reputation for excellence and professionalism.\nThe company’s ability to recruit both skilled labor and new clients gives the buyer of this business a tremendous foundation for long-term future success. As a result of this firm’s track record, many of the strongest recruits prefer to work directly with them rather than with other aviation staffing companies.\nThis business represents a unique opportunity for a buyer to acquire the company and then scale it quickly by targeting new contracts with government entities, MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) and aviation manufacturing facilities, tapping into a massive database of prospective clients in the private jet field, and pilot training and recruitment services. Implementing available technology such as a sourcing and information app could increase efficiency and attract new business.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business revealed several key value propositions for a buyer looking for a profitable business with decades of experience, strong name recognition, and a large and growing client base. We are excited about this business for three important reasons:\n1.Multiple Revenue Streams.The company’s revenue comes from multiple income streams. Pilot staffing has been their true bread and butter from the start, but the company also brings in revenue through the staffing of flight attendants and maintenance technicians, as well as through a program that provides pilot training. Their Pilot Training Program provides guidance and training to an operator new to aircrafts or aviation in general. The company also can expand into a host of additional services, including dispatching, recruitment, executive searches, and meeting other high-level staffing needs within the aviation field.\n2.Diverse Client Base.Their client base includes hundreds of well-known companies and wealthy individuals worldwide and across countless industries. The company does well in attracting government contracts and requests from wealthy private jet owners. The continuous need for business jet travel keeps new staffing requests coming in on a steady basis. The company has additional opportunities to pursue new government contracts and future growth in the MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) markets, aviation manufacturing, and staffing for other aviation needs such as dispatchers and personnel training.\n3.Strong Marketing.The fact that this company already has extensive brand recognition within the aviation industry is significant for a buyer since the company benefits from tremendous word-of-mouth referrals within this vertical. This has enabled the company to focus on attracting new clients by making presentations at trade shows and industry conferences, and bidding on government contracts without the need for an expensive marketing budget. However, the company has grown its sales by boosting organic traffic to its website through social media posts on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and especially through the LinkedIn business site, where the company has the highest engagement. The company has also optimized its website for SEO and used email marketing to target prospective clients in this industry. They benefit from having a massive database of subscribers who are aircraft owners and aviation department heads.\nThe Company\nThis agency was founded as a business aviation staffing company for the department of a major aircraft manufacturer in 2004, but has continued to grow and expand significantly since that time. The company continues to attract new business year over year, without being impacted by seasonal factors. They have a firm reputation for providing clients with qualified crew members who can support their client’s flight department’s operations and needs, and the company now has 400+ active clients worldwide on board.\nThe company is also notable for a very low churn rate. Only about 5% of clients stop using their services, typically because they sell their private jet, have become fully staffed, or go through a change of aviation management companies. The company receives very positive testimonials from its clients. Some of their clients sign up for multi-year contracts, and others have an annual renewal.\nIn addition to their recruits, the company maintains a secure database with all contractor documents, payment information, and other key details. These documents are updated regularly.\nOperations\nThe company has an experienced team in place that includes six full-time and four part-time employees, who manage daily operations, travel logistics, dispatching, training, invoice processing and accounting. This is an invaluable benefit for the new owner, since the existing staff can assist in learning about the aviation industry in general, review important details about clients and the requirements to staff their aircraft, and understand the operational processes (including dispatching, qualifying candidates, invoicing procedures and training operations).\nThe company is active in attending all private aviation industry trade shows as exhibitors, enabling them to highlight their services, meet with existing clients and crew members, as well as attracting new clients and crew members. Other key tools for driving sales include the company’s staffing support to financial institutions, aircraft manufactures, and aircraft brokers. The company works closely with financial institutions, manufactures, and brokers that are selling and/or leasing planes to new and existing clients. The company takes advantage of these opportunities to meet the new and existing private jet owners and build relationships that result in support of their flight departments for future staffing needs.\nToday, this company benefits from an industry-wide trend to outsource more and more Aviation Staffing. That, combined with the company’s impressive track record and clients who are required to utilize staffing agencies, provides the new owner a business with high recurring revenues, a strong customer base, and trustworthy name recognition within the industry. The company is also well positioned to grow as the staffing needs of the aviation industry are projected to remain in high demand.",

        "title": "SBA Pre-Qualified Online Business | Short Term Rental Platform & Operations Solutions | 136% YOY Growth | Experienced Management Team",
        "detail_description": "WebsiteClosers®presents an online company operating in the Short-Term Rental industry. This SBA Pre-Qualified agency provides everything a client needs to successfully operate an Airbnb or vacation home across the country. In less than 3 years, the company has created opportunity for more than 500+ short-term rentals.\nThe company’s consulting program has helped clients find a market where short-term rental properties thrive, and then a suitable property that meets their criteria. Additional services include providing live coaching calls, self-guided modules about this industry, and assisting clients in finding guests to stay at their property.\nThis program is now attracting 40 new clients a month, and the company’s consulting program, valued at $8,800, represents 60% of its profits. The other 40% comes from their interior design work. Once a client has signed a lease on a property, the company is available to provide a professional interior designer who can decorate the entire property while the client focuses on launching the business. This service can range from $14,000 to $20,000.\nThis business was the first in the nation to offer this kind of service for the short-term rental market, which is booming as more vacationing families and travelers opt to stay in fully furnished homes and condominiums rather than in a small hotel room. This agency has tapped into the excitement that many entrepreneurs have for the notion of opening a short-term rental, either as a form of passive income or to start a larger and more profitable chain of rentals.\nThe company is now enjoying a whopping 136% YoY Net Profit growth, while at the same time, this is a turnkey business that requires the current ownership to work no more than 10 hours per week or less. With an experienced management team in place, the new owner has an opportunity to take this business to soaring new heights as the short-term rental industry continues to grow by leaps and bounds.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly by directing marketing to additional states, and by launching premium or discount programs that attract a much wider income group.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\n1.Popular Services.The brand’s top services include an $8,800 package that helps clients find a strong market to operate a short-term rental in, as well as an attractive property. But their service doesn’t stop there. Clients can learn how to maximize profits from their new rental property, and their interior design service is another popular option. Additional services can include having this brand negotiate the lease with the landlord, and providing live coaching calls and self-guided modules on how vacation homes thrive. The company is now exploring opportunities to sell furniture for empty short-term rentals that need to be fully furnished. Clients have the option of signing up for two properties at a discounted rate of $13,000.\n2.The Company Operates Nationwide.While based in Florida, the company can accept clients across the U.S., although it now focuses mainly on states that allow licensing of short-term rental leases. This has enabled them to attract clients in top vacation states such as Colorado, Florida, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Texas, among others. The company’s clients tend to be entrepreneurs who earn $100,000+ annually and maintain a high credit score. Many of them have successful careers in fields such as technology and medicine or are real estate investors, and this company has enjoyed great success targeting and attracting high-income earners across the county. The company now has a $22,000+ Lifetime Customer Value.\n3.Vibrant Marketing Plan.The company has been able to use carefully targeted PPC ad campaigns on Google and social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram to attract clients eager to get into the short-term rental market. A blog on the company’s website also boosts its organic traffic and attracts more visitors to the website. The company also generates traffic through posts on TikTok and YouTube and has 1,700+ followers on Instagram and an email database of 10,000+ subscribers.\nThe Company\nFirst launched nearly 3 years ago, the company recognized a significant opening in the lucrative short-term rental industry. Their services not only take away the hard work of finding a suitable property for vacation or business travels, but also educates the entrepreneurs on how this industry succeeds. As the company has discovered, a lot of people were looking for a service like this one and eagerly signed up.\nThe company was the first in the nation to introduce this kind of service for short-term rental managers and owners, and while some competitors offer a coaching model, no active competitors are providing a full-service offer to do similar work for the client. Because the few competitors in this vertical do not have the proper real estate licensing, this company has a significant advantage over each one. This has created a very high barrier for potential competitors to get into this vertical by offering the same level of services this brand has.\nOperations\nThis is now a highly automated business, and the two owners often work less than 10 hours per week each, mostly focusing on conducting weekly meetings with their team, reviewing projections and financials, and overseeing content creation strategies.\nDaily operations are managed by four employees who oversee all office and administrative tasks. The company also employs four contractors as their Customer Success Team to handle all incoming client inquiries.\nEven more crucial to the company’s success has been their employment of 50 contractors who are licensed real estate professionals, instrumental in finding thriving short-term rental markets and properties, and the designers who decorate the properties.\nThe company also employs a copywriter for their email marketing campaigns.\nAs the short-term rental industry gets stronger, so will this business. There is unlikely to be a shortage anytime soon of individuals interested in operating a vacation home in a desirable location, and this company is ideally positioned to help them succeed. The fact that this company successfully attracts high-income clients demonstrates just how effective their services are.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents an eCommerce brand that has combined health science and technology to great effect in their proprietary product. They have developed and put to market an innovative-science-based wearable fitness and recovery technology, which currently has a provisional patent filed and a non-provisional utility patent waiting for a response from the USPTO. The exclusivity of their device and accompanying app has given the company an edge in their market, safeguarding their brand as they continue to grow with time.\nSince their launch, the company has enjoyed strong year-over-year growth in the health and fitness industry, meeting the growing demand for useful and effective wearable technology and recovery devices.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\nProduct Offering, Marketing, & Customer Base\nThe product is manufactured by a supplier with whom current ownership has developed a solid working relationship. This supplier has a large amount of capacity left, which will allow a buyer to keep working with them without having to seek out additional supplier relationships in the near term.\nTheir product is especially useful in targeting the stiff and dormant muscles that result from injury or neuromuscular issues and have added new settings tailored for warm-up routines that have been designed to stimulate muscles during rest or stretching to prepare them for vigorous exercise. These settings are highly useful for avoiding injuries to begin with, making them a great pick for physical therapists and athletes alike.\nThe brand’s flagship product is available in a bundle package, which costs $159.99 and includes two devices, a charging cord and brick, a carrying case, adhesives, alcohol wipes, and a product manual. They generate recurring revenue through their adhesive refill packs, which have proven to be fairly popular among their customer base.\nTheir advertising campaign largely consists of organic marketing efforts across all major social media platforms, such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and LinkedIn. They also run paid advertising on Meta and Google for a wider reach. The company’s average customer is a man between the ages of 35 and 44 who has an interest in weight or strength training and is looking to maintain their fitness and figure as they get older.\nScale Opportunities\nThere are several notable scale opportunities available to this brand, one of which being their aforementioned SaaS potential. The company could prompt their customers to pay a monthly subscription fee to access premium features on the app such as analytics, or lock some of the existing warm-up, workout, and recovery settings now integrated into this brand’s app behind a paywall.\nAdditionally, given the health-conscious focus of the product, the brand could find success by exploring the physical therapy and rehabilitation sectors. The sellers have already begun looking into the benefits of this strategy, and recently launched collaborations with physical therapy practices and athletic trainers. These trainers were very impressed with the device’s ability to activate target muscles accurately during rehabilitation exercises.\nLocalized Vibration Therapy increases muscle stress with less effort, making it a great option for at risk groups in need. This emphasis on the connection between the mind and body is vital for many post-surgical rehab programs and has set them apart from Electrical Muscle Stimulation devices that lack this focus.\nThey brand could release additional settings to their products to help reduce pain and muscle soreness, which would further cement the company as a portable and less intense alternative to massage guns, which can be overwhelming for some individuals and the elderly. The device could also be marketed to those suffering from paralysis due to conditions like Parkinson’s disease, as extensive research from renowned muscle physiologists Dr. Tom Maden-Wilkinson and Dr. Joe Handsaker indicates that vibration therapy can alleviate spasticity, which is responsible for muscle immobilization.\nThe company has notable potential to market to the government as well, as research has shown that vibration stimulation can elicit muscle responses in high-stress situations, and could even mitigate rapid muscle loss in space.\nConclusion\nThis acquisition has immense potential ahead of them, and a solid foundation that they can use to reach it. Their proprietary product has proven popular and effective enough that an ambitious buyer could, with the right strategies, market to entirely new consumer bases and significantly increase their revenue.",

This Digital Marketing Agency for Sale has been at this longer than most, which has helped it build strong reviews and a reputation for excellence.\nThey are well known for their SEO, PPC, Reputation Management, Public Relations, Web Design, Lead Generation and more. Plus, since they have a full team of 40 employees, including a highly seasoned management team, they provide a high level of customer service to their clients that many others in this sector cannot. This helps make them sticky, which helps to improve their retention rates and recurring revenue KPIs.\nThe company has a long list of awards and accolades, with many agencies and companies promoting them as the best in class for online Reputation Management, which is their specialty.\nWhile radio and television commercials and print advertisements did the job of putting brands out there in the past, with the transition to the digital age, countless businesses are finding themselves having to adapt to keep up with the times. Digital marketing offers several benefits over its older relative, such as affordability, intractability, molding a brand’s reputation, and the ability to reach more tech-savvy consumers. This has caused the digital marketing industry to thrive, and, in turn, propelled this company to their current size.\nThe agency’s clients pay a monthly retainer on a recurring basis for services rendered. All their participating partners have contractual obligations and are billed before services are rendered. This has led to high retention rates and long-standing customers. Most of their leads are generated via click-through traffic from the company website.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\nScale Opportunities\nThere are several notable growth opportunities an ambitious buyer might take an interest in, with the agency having already taken notice of and begun to implement a few. Strengthening and expanding upon their partnership networks, for instance, would improve their lead generation, and the agency has already established new partners this year.\nThey have also begun increasing their focus on organic traffic strategies to take advantage of the latest digital marketing trends, with the brand believing they can further increase their lead flow, future revenue, and overall profitability by continuing to invest in these ventures.\nA buyer may also find success by expanding their service portfolio to include cutting-edge technologies and platforms, which will let the company continue to adapt to rising industry trends. They could also do some advertising of their own by deploying aggressive marketing campaigns, which would allow them to capture a larger share of the market. Once this has been put into place, they could expand the agency into new geographic regions, giving them access to a larger pool of potential clients and expanding their market reach.\nConclusion\nThis company is based in a thriving industry, which is expected to continue to climb as more businesses look to build their digital footprint and improve their online reputations, which have become invaluable in such a tech-driven age. The agency is in a great position with their high-demand services, established brand, and glowing reviews across several platforms, giving them no shortage of scale opportunities that the right buyer can use to further strengthen this accomplished deal.",

They sell a variety of feminine care garments such as underwear, swimwear, sleepwear, and activewear, and offer first period kits for those who may be new to their time of the month. They have hundreds of SKUs that feature different colors, sizes, and styles, making it easier for customers to find the exact type of garment to suit their unique needs and preferences.\nTheir proprietary product line has won over many of their customers, with the reliability, variety, and utility of their SKUs earning them an impressive Repeat Customer Rate of 45%. They have an Average Order Value (AOV) of $101 and gross margins of roughly 70%.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\nScale Opportunities\nThe company has many other scale opportunities available outside of their wholesale potential, which can be used to bring them to the next level in the right hands. One low-hanging fruit for a buyer to pick would be to expand their product line. The company has sold men’s underwear in the past, and when they have, they have always sold out very quickly. By making men’s apparel a permanent addition to their stock, they could drastically increase their revenue and broaden their demographics.\nThe best way to scale this brand, however, would be to invest in their advertising strategy. While they have currently suspended all advertising, their historical ROAS is 2.5-3, and has easily reached 8 figures in revenue.\nThey could start by investing in paid advertising across Google, Facebook, and other popular platforms, and, from there, focus on other methods. Their social media marketing is one such option, which the brand is already considering expanding to include TikTok. They have nearly 170,000 followers on Meta that they could more fully engage, and a savvy buyer could expand their social media presence to great effect.\nTheir email marketing campaign is an underutilized channel, as while they have an extremely loyal customer base and do emails, they have yet to put together a full-on campaign to build up for any event or holiday. A proper campaign could fully utilize their 50,000-subscriber strong database and increase their Repeat Customer Rate.\nIn-person events have proven to be another good avenue for advertising, as pre-COVID the company put together a successful “Period Party” for girls and their mothers where they could do nail painting, get their hair done, etc. They could continue to run these events to improve their reputation and strengthen their customers’ loyalty and trust.\nAdditionally, the company has developed an athletic line and connected with well-known professional athletes that wanted to represent their product. The company elected not to move forward with them as they shifted focus to our top performing products, but following up on new sponsorships to promote their SKUs would likely lead to a significant spike in new potential customers looking into their products.\nConclusion\nThis 8-year-old company has a highly dedicated following behind them, which they have earned through their high-quality proprietary designs, polished operations, and dedication to establishing themselves as a reliable brand in touch with common issues women struggle with. They have plenty of scale opportunities that the right buyer could utilize, giving them great potential for their new owner’s portfolio.",

A state or municipal government agency may want to use this data to ensure vacation homes are compliant with local rules. Investors could use it to make savvy decisions on which real estate markets to invest in. The data is all-inclusive so it can provide an important tool regardless of who the client is or what they need it for. The platform is utilized at different levels by a wide variety of customers.\nThe company and its contract renewals are not impacted by seasonal factors, even though the short-term rental market can be. Since families vacation all year round, property managers and owners are in constant need of fresh data to help them prepare for the next competitive travel season.\nOperations & Marketing\nThe current owner operates this business with the assistance of 11 full-time employees and several supplemental contractors hired on an as-needed basis. These workers are highly experienced professionals, who create a management team that is expert at technology, programming, data engineering, sales, and UX/UI designs. It’s an impressive team, with a combined 40+ years of short-term rental experience.\nConsidering that most clients are providing the company with recurring revenue through its subscriptions, a new owner can take full advantage of that expertise to focus on the company’s many scale opportunities. This product is fully built out and requires no fine-tuning or modifications from a new owner, and its day-to-day operations now focus on supporting existing customers, sales, and general business activities.\nThe company has used some marketing tools to boost sales. There is a basic SEO framework to the website, which could easily be updated, and the company has a blog focused on travel issues to drive traffic to the site. A significant growth possibility for this company would be to launch a second blog focused on its technology and the platform itself, and the advantages of using the platform.\nThe company also has a basic affiliate marketing infrastructure that uses customer testimonials to attract new clients, and that is another tool that could be significantly expanded and updated. With these systems in place, a new owner needs only the right marketing tools to bring added exposure to the website, and the potential for skyrocketing revenue increases is there.\nThis company now needs sales support to accelerate its growth. Since the Vacation Rentals Market in the U.S. alone is projected to generate $19 billion in revenue by the end of 2024, the potential for this company to scale rapidly with greater exposure is obvious.",

        "title": "Celebrity Endorsed CPG Lifestyle Brand | Taylor Swift, Kylie Jenner & More | 100% Website Sales | Valuable IP Assets | 40% Repeat Order Rate",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a one-of-a-kind eCommerce Brand that pioneered unique Phone Cases that define their brand’s success. They took the standard idea of a protective phone cover and dialed it up to eleven with their highly fashionable, functional, and highly unique products, which have grown so popular that they have been organically embraced by A-Listers like Taylor Swift and Kylie Jenner.\nThey put their nose to the grindstone throughout the last 3 years, bringing their growth thus far to $14 million in annual revenue. They’re on pace to hit $20 million in 2024, and with proper funding, the brand has the potential to reach $100 million in 3 to 5 years. The brand is super-sticky with consumers, not just because of the celebrity endorsements, which are voluminous, but also because they want to purchase more and more of them so they have many options to choose from when they go out (much like a purse). To this end, the brand sees a Repeat Order Rate of 40%, which is proof positive that people love these high quality products.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways:\n1. Proprietary Products (Moats). Their customers’ phones aren’t the only things that they keep safe. They have proprietary protection in place for their brand through patents and global trademark registrations, keeping any competitors from infringing on their designs. This step has been incredibly important for the long-term growth of the brand as they received accolades and attention from the Wall Street Journal, SPY.com, A-listers, and, of course, the everyday consumer eager to turn their phones into fabulous fashion accessories. This is not a phone case company, but a fashion accessory company with customers buying different cases to compliment seasons, outfits, occasions and events. To this end, many additional products in adjacent categories would be fitting under this brand.\n2. Engaged, Social Driven Audience. The love that celebrities have shown the brand hasn’t gone unnoticed by other customers. The organic marketing that these celebrities generate through their selfies has contributed to the average of 550,000 visitors the company’s site sees per month, with their organic traffic rate sitting at 83% of mix. Additionally, since their products act as both accessory and protection, customers often return to pick up more customization options for their phone. Their Repeat Purchase Rate is 40%, and their average product rating is difficult-to-achieve 4.8-stars.\n3. Strong Content and UGC Marketing. Their marketing campaign encourages an ongoing dialogue with customers, building the brand/buyer bond while spreading awareness of their products. They work with influencers to promote their cases, run Meta, Google, and programmatic ads, and frequently send their 1.1 million email subscribers and 150,000 SMS subs messages to encourage repeat purchases. Their SEO campaign is focused on their product name in organic searches, which has proven to be a very successful source over year-over-year (YOY) growth.\nTheir brand has flourished to the point of being able to offer 250 active SKUs across 4 categories, with no SKU concentration in their sales. Their average customer is a woman between the ages of 24 and 54 interested in bold, attention-grabbing products. These women are proud fashionistas with their finger on the pulse of the latest trends, which means that they’re more likely to notice what’s hot among their favorite celebrities.\nOperations\nThe company’s team consists of 1 employee, an operations manager, and 4 contractors, acting as a graphic artist, a social media coordinator, and two customer service agents. Current ownership oversees the team through email and group calls, and they have cultivated a culture that puts the customer first across all departments. This team is anticipated to stay on with the business postsale unless the buyer has an operations team in place.\nTwo owners divide their tasks between them. One is responsible for overseeing marketing/site metrics, cashflow/financials, website UX updates and inventory, while the other looks after social media, marketing content/tactics, website UI updates and customer service. Ownership is excited for the future of this brand and is willing to retain equity for the right buyer.\nScale Opportunities\nThere are various untapped sales and marketing channels that are primed for the brand’s expansion and represent massive opportunities for the brand. They already have several new products in the pipeline waiting to be launched, and by continually adding new and higher priced products, they can steadily add to their revenue, increase AOV and promote cross-selling. Expanding into maleoriented phone cases is also promising, as male celebrities like Ryan Reynolds have already organically picked the product up.\nThe brand is primed to start selling wholesale. Scaling into this channel would be seamless and their products are already in wholesale packaging with GS1 labeled UPCs. They have existing requests from Best Buy, Verizon, and Revolve Clothing for wholesale, which would be a great opportunity for a buyer with more experience dealing with the wholesale/big box market.\nWhile Amazon’s Brand Registry is in place, the company has not yet begun to sell on the world’s largest shopping platform. Huge opportunity exists to extend the brand’s reach by selling on Amazon.\nThe company could bolster their marketing campaign by continuing to scale their paid ads and by utilizing new channels like TikTok. They can establish celebrity partnerships with Taylor Swift and some of the other celebrities on their customer list to promote their products, and optimize their marketing by taking steps like hiring an in-house media buyer to save on agency fees. Brand partnership opportunities are emerging as well including a recent outreach by CoverGirl.\nCanada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Mexico, and South America have proven to be profitable prospects to scale in for a larger international customer base.\nThe brand and product mix lends itself well to the subscription model, particularly considering the already high repeat purchase rate and the consistent release of new designs every other week.\nFinally, the company has already initiated discussions with Tapcart, a reputable app responsible for creating apps for many of the major brands on Shopify Plus. They can have an app designed for the business and ready to go live within 30 to 45 days, which would open the potential for advertising through free push notifications and a new marketing channel.\nConclusion\nThis is one opportunity that shouldn’t be put on hold. They have been recognized by celebrities and everyday customers alike as a fashionable-yet-functional statement piece to protect their phones, while having a proprietary shape that makes them more comfortable to hold over traditional alternatives. They’re primed through growth with their new pipeline, and a buyer who knows their way around Amazon and/or wholesale will enjoy plenty of opportunities to send this phenomenal brand to the next level.",

They have used their decades of industry experience to meticulously curate a network of top-tier vendors that span across various locations, both domestic and international.\nThese suppliers have given the company access to a variety of promotional product categories, such as personalized apparel, awards, bags/totes, desk/office products, client gifts, and their best-selling product, logo mats.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways\nOperations\nThe company has an excellent operational team, which act in the following roles:\nThis team has significantly cut down on the workload that the owner must manage, with the current owner requiring roughly 10 to 15 hours per week to handle administrative tasks, books, payroll, and paying vendors. As the future owner would see a very minimal monthly workload, they would have more time to focus on new products and business expansion.\nScale Opportunities\nAn ambitious buyer can continue growing this seasoned business by expanding upon the tactics that they have already started putting into place and implementing a few new ones. They could launch in other niches in the hotel, schools/universities, or sports market for a larger consumer base, then increase their marketing to better target these new potential clients.\nA buyer could improve their marketing by bringing on additional sales reps to target larger businesses in need of promo products or mats and increase the marketing budget for their custom mats. As very little SEO/ads have currently been run for the company, investing in these efforts could possibly generate a large amount of revenue.\nConclusion\nThis established enterprise offers an exciting opportunity to break into a massive industry that caters to large and small businesses alike. They have a valuable supplier network in place, strong business-buyer relationships with their clients, and have been continuing to grow even after three decades of operation. In the hands of the right buyer, they can continue cultivating their consumer base and reach entirely new heights.\nIf you’d like to learn more about this deal, then please contact Website Closers for more information today.",

They then offer a host of additional services to help make the business a success. With an experienced team in place that has serviced 800+ clients, and a fast-growing 50% renewal rate, more than 40% of their clients stay on to take advantages of additional services.\nThe company is growing rapidly with TTM earnings over $2M and 2022 and 2023 earnings hitting $900k and $1.8M, respectively. While the company’s startup package costs $10,000, a host of additional services cost anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000. A growing number of clients sign up for services that range from $20,000 to $50,000.\nAt a time when the eCommerce industry is booming and new online businesses are launched daily, this agency’s services are in high demand among entrepreneurs who want to hit the ground running and establish their digital store as quickly as possible using the tools and experience necessary to put themselves in a position to be successful. The company continues to grow and now attracts 25 new clients a month. The agency has a wide range of services to offer new and existing eCommerce business owners and has launched a new full-service offering.\nWith such a diverse array of services, this company has limited competition. There are no known eCommerce service companies that offer a similar suite of services and this agency is quickly becoming a leader in this field.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a U.S. Buyer to acquire this company and then scale it quickly by continuing to launch new services, targeting more B2B clients rather than individual entrepreneurs, and expanding into new markets.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business revealed several key value propositions for a buyer looking for a profitable eCommerce company whose clients are also eCommerce businesses. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\nThe Company\nLaunched in 2017, the company started as a hobby but grew rapidly and became a full-time service almost overnight. It instantly became clear there was a strong base for their services, which continued expanding, and now includes bundled packages.\nThe different services are tailored to the needs of each client, and products and services include Storefunnel software, books, and online courses on running an eCommerce business. As they have grown, today the company’s average new client deal is a package worth $15,000. In addition to nearly half of those clients coming back for additional services, they pay $74 a month to access the company’s store funnels software.\nWith between 15 and 25 new clients coming on board every month, their typical client is an investment-minded individual, typically age 35 or older, with long-term goals and an understanding that it can take a while to build up a successful eCommerce business.\nOperations & Marketing\nFor a company that helps clients launch a successful marketing campaign, the agency clearly understands how to market its own website. They created a call booking funnel and consistently run ads promoting it. If clients who contact them have the funds needed to work with the agency, their fulfillment team begins working on their account.\nThe call booking funnel is advertised in numerous ways, including PPC ads on Google and paid advertising on Facebook and YouTube. The company also posts content daily on social media including new videos and podcasts promoting their services, and their SEO program includes a blog that gets updated twice a week.\nThese tools have been effective in bringing new clients to their website on a regular basis. The company also has an email database of 52,000+ subscribers to tap into.\nThe current owner is available to stay on board in a minority equity position or to provide consultation to ensure a smooth and profitable transition to the new ownership.\nEver since the pandemic lockdowns shifted consumers to making online purchases and mobile apps transformed the convenience of shopping online, the eCommerce industry has been growing by phenomenal leaps and bounds, and 2024 is shaping up to be no exception to that trend. That’s encouraging more and more people to become business owners operating out of their living rooms and on their laptops, creating online stores to attract customers and profits. Many of them will need help getting started, which is why this agency is growing so quickly.\nFor a buyer, this is an opportunity to take on a very profitable eCommerce company that is serving other entrepreneurs, successfully, and now needs a buyer committed to growing the company.",

        "title": "150 Location Business | Assisted Tax Preparation Firm | 7 State Operation | Strong Recurring Revenue | Multiple Revenue Sources | General & Regional Managers in Place",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a flourishing Tax Preparation Firm with over 150 individual locations serving individuals and small businesses alike. The company is nationally recognized and well-established and has demonstrated strong and consistent financial performance, with healthy year-over-year bottom-line growth.\nThe industry is broadly divided into two categories: DIY and Assisted Services. The former assists customers via their websites, enabling them to file their state and federal income taxes unassisted. This group operates in the latter sector and has become an authority in the Assisted niche. The model is based on customers visiting physical locations and seeking professional help to file a tax return. Over the years, the number of individuals filing assisted returns has stabilized, and presently, about 80 million seek assistance in the US annually.\nBUSINESS BROKER TAKEAWAYS\nOur analysis of this tax preparation business for sale highlights 3 primary valuation propositions:\nADDITIONAL REVENUE STREAMS\nThe core product in December facilitates hooking customers into returning and doing their tax returns once their W2 is released. Currently, the company’s main competitors do not execute this product the same way since their approval rates are too low, and most locations are not open pre-season.\nThe company has operations inside Walmart stores. This is incredibly valuable during the ERA season because all the customer needs is their latest paystub on a mobile phone and a valid ID. Once presented, the application can be completed immediately, and funds can be delivered to customers within the hour while they shop in or around Walmart.\nWhen W2s come in, those same customers return to complete their taxes, and at that point, a different loan is underwritten. This gives the customer the bulk of their tax refund on the same day rather than waiting weeks for the IRS to process it. This is the cornerstone of the model’s success, as this segment of customers constitutes approximately 50% of the total revenue.\nThe remainder of the business is regular tax preparation, and the company competes for that segment based on price.\nSCALE OPPORTUNITIES\nNumerous avenues can be explored to expand this company dramatically. Optimizing the store count is worth considering. Since acquiring the business, the sellers have closed certain unprofitable stores each year. Since their territories are close in proximity, customers can easily be moved to more profitable offices, boosting the bottom line. Additionally, the group has 155 stores in 7 states. More cities, states and regions are available for expansion given the firm’s national notoriety.\nCurrent tax preparers are typically underutilized. The business has approximately a 34% utilization rate throughout the tax season since certain stores are busier than others. Subsequently, virtual tax returns are an enormous opportunity. The technology exists, and with some incremental investments in webcams, computers, and the proper training, a buyer could reduce staffing further to make the operation more profitable. Customers would visit the branches as usual but gain assistance via Zoom from whoever is available, maximizing workforce utilization. A General Manager has been tasked exclusively with setting this up.\nTraditional marketing, such as fliers, billboards, and branded merchandise, has been the primary advertising approach. Implementing an aggressive and comprehensive digital marketing strategy is low-hanging fruit to target and convert new customers while being able to track the return on investment accurately.\nGiven access to capital, the most straightforward growth path is to continue acquiring locations from retiring operators and adding to the existing footprint. The current owners have grown this way since beginning operations.",

The company assists eCommerce business owners with automation and logistical support to propel their ventures to new heights. It boasts strong financial performance, a recurring revenue model, and an enthusiastic and broad customer base. The owners have strategically positioned the company for global expansion, presenting a buyer with an enormous opportunity to realize a swift return on investment and limitless scale potential.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions are strong for a buyer looking to enter this space. We are excited about this business for three important reasons:\nAdditional Valuation Points\nUnlike alternative options, the company is highly attractive to ambitious prospective entrepreneurs because it supports them throughout the process of opening and running a business. This has led to higher conversion rates and customer retention. The agency retains up to 15,000 monthly customers and a similar volume requiring logistical support.\nA proficient team is in place that comprises numerous managers with an intimate understanding of day-to-day operations. Subsequently, the owners endure a light workload of fewer than ten hours weekly, enabling a buyer to focus their energy on scale initiatives.\nAll processes have been systemized extensively, positioning the business for seamless expansion in both existing regions and new countries.\nA stellar reputation has been cultivated through testimonials from satisfied clients and word-of-mouth referrals. Combined with a highly effective advertising strategy, the company’s websites now attract 100,000 monthly visitors.\nCompetition is minimal since the company provides a full-service offering from store development, product sourcing and fulfillment, logistics, and performance marketing. Others offer assistance in certain aspects but are unable to provide new entrepreneurs with a full suite of services.\nMarketing & Revenue Generation\nA highly fruitful marketing strategy has been employed, primarily comprising advertising on Facebook and YouTube. These two channels drive 80% of sales and boast healthy returns on ad spend, especially given customer longevity with the new model. Additional income is derived from email campaigns designed to upsell supplementary services to existing clients. The remainder is obtained organically and via a robust affiliate program. The program is incredibly cost-effective since affiliates receive 30% of the sale for each new customer or one month of free agency management. Because of customer lifetime value, this has proven lucrative, and the owner is now in the process of onboarding over 500 new customers without having spent excessively on advertising.\nRevenue is diversified further through two websites catering to different audiences. One serves prospective new customers by offering them automation training. Here, they book a call to receive more information and are guided through the funnel by a proficient team that has demonstrated excellent conversion rates. The other focuses on existing clients and continual education. The membership-based community is proliferating and has contributed to making this company the largest automation agency in Italy.\nWorkload & Personnel\nThe founders’ ingenuity is evident in how they have dramatically grown the company while reducing staff. By implementing effective systems and a management team, they have condensed employees from 40 to 12 contractors. Additionally, the owner now dedicates as little as ten hours weekly to the business, focusing on overseeing automation customers.\nOpportunity\nMany individuals are entering the eCommerce landscape daily, needing more expertise and experience to succeed. Subsequently, they seek a comprehensive solution and continuous guidance to assist them. The stage is set for dramatic international expansion and unlimited scale. A buyer can operate this company from any location and could quickly tap into the vast US customer base while continuing to dominate the European market.",

Sales of these uniquely designed and proprietary SKUs brought this company $1.3 million in its first year and the company is now enjoying 30% profit margins.\nWith 15 SKUs that sell briskly throughout the year at an Average Order Value of $64, the company gets its sales in the U.S. and across Europe, with peaks around the holiday gifting season.\nThis business represents a clear opportunity for a Buyer to acquire this company, then scale it rapidly by launching new Gift items and investing in an international expansion using Amazon’s foreign platforms.\nThe company has demonstrated a clear talent for customer engagement through social media platforms. The brand has a whopping 630,000+ followers including 280,000+ on TikTok, 200,000+ on Instagram, and 150,000+ on Facebook. This not only gives the brand huge opportunities to connect with new customers but also drives high levels of organic traffic to their website. The site now receives 118,000+ unique monthly visitors.\nThe company has other strengths for a buyer to consider. That includes their exclusive relationship with their main supplier, which ensures both the current ownership and a new owner of continued competitive pricing and a consistent supply chain.\nThis is also a highly automated business. The current owner works just one hour per day, and some of those tasks could be managed in the future by a virtual assistant. The buyer can take full advantage of the company’s rising profits, strong recurring revenues, and creative marketing techniques to focus on scaling the business.\nThe Gifting industry is certainly an evergreen and enormously lucrative one since people around the globe buy gifts for a long list of occasions, from holidays to birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, graduations, and more. The Global Gift Industry is expected to reach $43 billion by 2027, driven in part by the availability of unique products online and by social media sites promoting them. Studies indicate that 69% of consumers prefer giving gifts to receiving them, so sales are only expected to keep rising as customers search for new, innovative, and specialized gift items.\nThis brand has benefited from those trends since 8 of its 15 SKUs are designed exclusively for this company.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business revealed several key value propositions for a buyer looking for an online company enjoying fast-rising profits in an evergreen and high-demand vertical, with proprietary products and the ability to scale quickly. We anticipate buyers will recognize that value for 3 important reasons:\nThe Company\nThis brand has effectively demonstrated that the design of calendars can keep evolving in unique ways that capture the imagination of the public. This has included designing them as pieces of art and incorporating lighting elements to make them both functional as calendars and also as decorative items. The company has done particularly well with interactive products that include a light-up calendar, popular both as a décor item and as a hobby activity.\nAll products are sold under the company’s brand name, and eight models are manufactured specifically for the business.  Products are purchased directly from the supplier and then shipped to a warehouse operated by a third-party logistics partner.\nDemand for their products tends to soar during the holiday season when gift-giving is at its highest, and the company also enjoys a significant spike in calendar sales toward the end of the year as the new year approaches.\nOperations & Marketing\nThis turnkey operation doesn’t require a heavy workload for the new owner. The current owner works just an hour a day on the business, focusing on developing the brand by exploring new product ideas, passing orders to their logistics team, and answering specific inquiries from customers. A virtual assistant handles all other customer service issues.\nAll products are shipped from the warehouse to a fulfillment center, and the company typically stocks around $45,000 worth of inventory to keep up with orders.  All orders are shipped in a customized product box with the brand logo and a discount code inside that can be applied to a future order.\nThe new owner will be able to take advantage of the brand’s robust digital marketing plan that drives high organic traffic levels to the website. The company has hundreds of thousands of followers across multiple social media channels, and that has brought more than 1.4 million visitors to its website in the past year.\nThe company also runs PPC ad campaigns on Facebook and Instagram, which also boosts traffic to their website, and they post one product video a week on social media.\nThere are plenty of options for a new owner looking to scale the business through new marketing tools, including starting an SEO program that uses keywords in product descriptions to get higher rankings in search engines, and a blog on the website to further expand their customer base.\nThe new owner could also explore email and SMS text messaging.\nThis business was able to capture a significant audience in just a year and is enjoying high profits as a result. As a highly automated business, this is the ideal operation for a new owner to scale.",

Its Shopify-built website offers a well-curated catalog of over 440 products without concentration on any given SKUs. The store attracts considerable traffic via robust ad click-through rates, boasts strong conversions, and has a healthy customer acquisition cost. Its $45 Average Order Value also achieves solid margins while appealing to a broad customer base\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for three important reasons:\nMarketing\nJewelry remains a perennially popular niche, experiencing notable sales increases in anticipation of major holidays such as Mother’s Day, Valentine’s Day, and the Q4 holiday season. As a result, advertising competition on social media platforms also exhibits seasonality. For instance, while January might be presumed to be a slow period due to its placement after Christmas, the reality is quite the contrary. With significantly reduced competition on social media during January, this company’s advertising efforts yield approximately 30% greater reach for the same investment, making it their most lucrative month.\nThe strategy currently employs Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns, achieving a consistent ROAS. Due to the substantial profit margins, net income, after accounting for all expenses, is 17%.\nIn addition, email marketing campaigns are conducted three times weekly, with each dispatch generating sales between $700 and $1,300.\nBoth strategies present vast opportunities for growth under a motivated new owner. The company has not expanded its advertising budget, introduced new creative content, or developed new email campaigns in over a year. Despite this, it has observed consistent performance with minimal oversight.\nWorkload & Team\nAlthough the owner’s current workload is only around 30 minutes daily, much of it can easily be delegated to a virtual assistant if a buyer desires to reduce it further. Daily responsibilities include procuring orders from the supplier in a straightforward and automated process.\nEmail marketing campaigns are dispatched on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Since they have been crafted for the entirety of 2024, the role simply involves sending out the campaign that aligns with the corresponding date.\nOnly two additional employees are required, both of whom work as customer support contractors\nOutlook\nAlthough no special skills are necessary for a buyer to enjoy continued success, one possessing a nuanced understanding of social media marketing and product branding is poised to experience substantial growth.\nThe business is in a strong financial position, providing an excellent platform for a new owner who can bring enthusiasm, innovation, and strategic vision. There’s a significant opportunity to leverage the existing cash flow to enhance branding, expand market presence, and ultimately accelerate growth.",

The business is a leader in its niche industry – providing lead generation services for the Medical Billing Vertical. They specialize in generating warm leads from medical practices looking to outsource their medical billing; leads get routed to 3rd party medical billing companies.\nWhile they compete with roughly 5 different companies in their industry, they stand out by being one of the larger volume players in the market, with their product converting into paid clients at or below their client’s allowable customer acquisition goals.\nLeads are generated through the customizability of their services, which includes geography/practice area, shared/exclusive routing options and fast setup. Once a partner takes an interest in their services, the brand requires them to prepay approximately one month’s worth of leads. Each time they route the partner, they deduct the price of that lead from their balance. The partners add more prepayments to their balance in order to continue receiving leads.\nTheir services have won over a healthy mix of both wholesale and retail clients, with about 40% of their volume routing to wholesale buyers and the rest being retail. They see little seasonality and enjoy consistent and stable earnings.\nBusiness Broker Takeaways:\n\nScale Opportunities\nOutside of expansion, the brand could also be bolstered through additional marketing. Paid search has produced the highest intent service requests thus far for the company, and their paid search accounts still have plenty of opportunity to get more granularity and capture more quality volume with additional investment. Additionally, as the brand has yet to make use of social media marketing, doing so could be an excellent tactic for attracting new leads.\nTheir improved marketing could also help the brand increase their number of pre-paid customers, which would, in turn, boost their monthly working capital.\nConclusion\nThis acquisition has a healthy amount of potential, and has been up to be a steady, turnkey source of income for their ownership. The light workload that the owner will need to run operations gives them ample time to focus on scaling or any of their other opportunities, providing them with valuable flexibility in their schedule. The ideal buyer would understand paid search, lead routing and account management, and could see the potential to lead this brand to even greater heights.",

The agency is unique in that it goes beyond creating promotional plans by also implementing them with its own committed field team.\nThe staff embodies the essence of Hispanic consumers in their professional and personal lives, leveraging this distinct perspective to benefit their clients and enabling brands to engage effectively with this influential consumer group. With the Hispanic demographic contributing to nearly half of the US population growth and possessing a collective purchasing power of $1.7 trillion, it represents a pivotal market segment.

The team has collaborated with a spectrum of retailers, ranging from Hispanic independents to major market players such as Walmart, Home Depot, and CVS.\nThe business model encompasses both core and seasonal aspects. The core entails clients on retainer with an extensive scope of work, where annual initiatives are implemented.

Along with glowing reviews and testimonials, it serves as a testament to the product’s demand and superiority in the market.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\nThe core product is exceptionally unique, and the vertical is in high demand. It is sold exclusively under the brand name and sourced naturally rather than being “farmed.” As a result, it leads the market in extract concentration, thereby being more effective than other iterations.\nThe business employs minimal marketing yet enjoys repeat purchases organically, reducing Customer Acquisition Costs. The impressive 40% Repeat Purchase Rate indicates a substantial opportunity for potential buyers, as it not only promises a consistent flow of revenue but also presents a golden chance to consistently upsell additional products to these loyal customers.\nManagement utilizes an advantageous inventory model with their supplier, with whom they have developed a strong relationship. The supplier handles all fulfillment and inventory management, significantly reducing the workload and personnel requirements. Additionally, favorable payment terms have been negotiated, and the company is invoiced weekly in arrears for sold items. These factors contribute to abundant cash flow and low working capital requirements.\nThe Product\nRaw materials for the tincture are gathered by indigenous Americans who have used this formula since before the founding of the United States. They are grown and harvested naturally in the wild, delivering a tincture of the highest quality and potency. The extract has become increasingly popular with recovering cancer patients as it provides a rapid immune recovery for those suffering from the disease. It is also commonly used for daily immune restoration and prophylactic use and has proven anti-tumor properties.\nAnother pertinent factor is that the extract is medically acknowledged as effective. Subsequently, the business is poised to ride the rapidly expanding CBD wave with a natural, complementary mushroom product that is recognized as more effective for:\nThe brand has predominantly grown organically. Digital marketing efforts comprise only customer testimonials through Facebook advertising. Typical customers are 35 and older, primarily with chronic health conditions such as cancer. The lifetime value of each is $418, and they place an average of 2.67 orders.\nWorkload & Expansion Opportunities\nThe two owners currently dedicate less than 1 hour weekly to the business. Their core task is approving payroll. A lean part-time staff consists of a manager handling day-to-day operations and two customer support representatives.\nThe scalability and growth potential of the brand are significant and remain virtually untapped as the current owner has operated the company at a maintenance level for several years due to other career obligations demanding his time. In 2022, there were 1.9 million new cancer patients in the US alone, and the market for this effective, helpful product is ripe for the picking. Subsequently, an ambitious buyer can take full advantage of numerous scale opportunities to boost the top and bottom lines considerably and swiftly.\nImplementing a robust digital marketing strategy is essential for the business, which currently relies on organic traffic and limited Facebook advertising. A skilled buyer can transform the online presence by launching targeted campaigns on social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest, expanding the audience reach. Additionally, a well-crafted email marketing strategy offers a cost-effective way to acquire and retain customers, fostering direct communication for promotions and product launches.\nEnhancing website SEO is crucial for better visibility in search engines, attracting potential customers actively searching for immune-boosting products. Expanding sales to additional platforms like Amazon represents a significant opportunity for dramatic sales growth, leveraging the eCommerce giant’s vast audience and streamlined logistics. Exploring partnerships with Medical Marijuana Dispensaries could prove highly lucrative by tapping into the thriving market for natural alternatives, creating a new revenue stream.\nAdditionally, diversifying the product line with new SKUs, like Pet Immunity, caters to individuals seeking natural solutions. A strategic move like this could boost sales and capitalize on the growing market for holistic pet care.\nNo medical knowledge or special skills are required to own and operate the business, and there is no requirement for a warehouse or inventory. While a basic understanding of the mushroom therapeutics would be helpful, this can be learned in a matter of hours. As a result, the company is ideal for a firsttime buyer or an experienced eCommerce operator who can enjoy a brisk return on investment.\n",

However, one of the most impressive aspects of this acquisition has been their 85% customer retention rate, which is a remarkable trait to find among just about any eCommerce brand.\nHere are some of the other reasons why our brokers are excited about this deal.\nWhile the current ownership acquired these brands several years ago, each has been operating for some time, with their nutritional supplements site being the oldest at over 20 years. Their age has given them a solid digital presence in the lucrative health care, wellness and beauty care market, and a well-established reputation. Their customers are often happy to praise their products, giving them a great source of word-of-mouth advertising.\nOrganic advertising isn’t their only method of targeting new customers. The company has over 100,000 subscribers in their database, which they make use of through an email marketing strategy that keeps customers engaged and drives repeat sales. They supplement this with SMS text messaging, Google PPC ads, and Amazon PPC ads. Their Amazon ads have been especially effective in attracting new customers through a strategy that focuses on obtaining higher conversion rates than their rivals, drawing fresh eyes to their products.\nThe company markets across multiple sales channels, including Amazon, Walmart, and Target. Though some of their products are most popular on their Shopify storefronts, others have excelled on Amazon, providing the business with high recurring and diversified revenue. While there’s plenty of competition to be found across these sites, they have set themselves apart with their excellent products and marketing tactics, and have been able to take advantage of the rising interest in buying health-related products from online shops.\nThe company is the owner of many of their formulas, which keeps customers coming back for products that they can’t find anywhere else. These products are made with the commitment to providing high-quality and all-natural wellness products that enhance their customers’ day-to-day lives. Their SKUs have an especially strong appeal among consumers interested in taking a holistic approach to their health and beauty needs, letting the brand target a highly diverse consumer base: from parents interested in boosting their children’s health, to older demographics hoping to look after their own bodies.\nTheir products are manufactured by reliable suppliers in both the US and overseas plants, and they possess inhouse manufacturing capabilities that add to their exclusivity and control over product quality. All their SKUs are manufactured specifically for them\nEach brand has its own top-selling products, keeping the company from being reliant on any single product for their profits. Their Average Order Value (AOV) varies from $109.45 to $29.18, and their diverse mix of products keep them from being impacted by seasonal factors.\nThis acquisition is highly turnkey, with a capable and highly skilled team in place to keep the gears turning as they should. Their daily operations are handled by an experienced team that includes a marketing manager, fulfillment manager, Amazon specialist, and supply chain manager. They use Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) to ensure quick shipment times, improving their customer satisfaction levels. Their inventory is stocked in a 4,000- square-foot warehouse in Miami before being sent to FBA.\nDespite the business consisting of 3 brands, their operations have been streamlined to the point that the current ownership requires as little as 5 hours per week or less on management.\nTheir extensive range of products across niche, yet profitable and ever-growing fields has a fantastic position to grow, which is only bolstered by their masterful approach to generating sales. With a variety of ways to scale each brand, a skilled buyer will be able to grow these 3 brands into even stronger sources of profit.",

Plans include finalizing a proprietary app and expanding the marketplace model to cater to other organizations and interests beyond Freemasonry. This strategic approach leverages the brand’s strong foundation in the niche to drive broader ventures.\nThe business represents a compelling investment opportunity.

Thanks to their marketing strategies, they have great margins: 88% on a $165 AOV. They can still keep a lot of money in their pockets after reinvesting in ads and inventory.\nThe buyer can scale any paid media channel easily, without the stress of running out of content for new creatives. This is a huge advantage over any other competitors because buyers can test more creatives and find more winners.\nThe brand is an agile, efficient company.

Realizing the potential that this new storefront held, management applied the same system they used in Italy to find 600 influencers in the US. This strategy paid off, and while they enjoy sales across Canada and Australia, their revenue is now almost entirely generated through the US.\nFrom there, the brand began seeing positive results through Facebook Ads, with this strategy now accounting for 50% of their total revenue. The rest is evenly divided between influencers and organic traffic. Their unique marketing strategy has allowed the brand to maintain a low CPA with influencers of only $10, while keeping their profit margins as high as 60%. They have seen an exceptional year-over-year (YOY) growth of 274%, and have consistently exceeded their projections.\nTheir complementary products include an Enzymatic Peeling Gel and a Green Clay Mask, which are produced by an Italian cosmetic lab and are designed to improve the results of the blackhead device.\nThe brand’s additional products include a callus remover, which was launched in December 2022.

This product is now in the back end of the brand and promoted via emails and retargeting ads. They introduced a heated eyelash curler in January 2023, which has shown equally impressive margins, and management is in the process of testing different price points. They have also recently added a few new products to the roster, such as some great selling cremes.\nTheir success can be traced back to several factors, with one of the most prominent being that their device provides immediate, visible results without hurting the user’s face. Their competitors’ products, meanwhile, often feature reviews noting that they cause pain, with most not even providing satisfactory results to make up for it either. The owner accomplished this by doing substantial research into the best supplier and a device design that is both safe and effective.\nAdditionally, the brand proudly showcases the effectiveness of their products through demonstrations in influencers’ videos and social media ads. These videos show how, after just five minutes of use, the blackheads, impurities, and whiteheads that the device has extracted from the skin are clearly visible, promising quick gratification to the customer through the brand’s product.\nTheir device is so effective, in fact, that it is used and trusted by aesthetic MDs, doctors, beauticians, and face surgeons for their work, even though it isn’t manufactured for professional use. The brand has compiled several testimonial videos from these professionals that could be used for marketing purposes.\nThe company enjoys exemplary profit margins, which, combined with their marketing strategies, has given them a steady cash flow even after they reinvested in new inventory. They boast a database of over 50,000 customers.\nOne of the current management’s best strengths, if not the best, has been assembling the brand’s unique influencer marketing strategy. This has let them:\nThere are many other valuable traits and growth opportunities at this brand’s disposal, with the brand being able to scale in multiple new countries by simply copy-pasting their existing strategy. This gave them their fantastic results in the US, and they have already set their eyes on other European countries next for future growth.\nAnother valuable asset is their catalog of over 1,000 videos, which feature women from a wide range of demographics using their products. The buyer will have full commercial rights to use them, making it possible for them to easily scale any paid media channel without running out of content for new creatives. This offers them an incredible advantage, as more creatives can be tested to find those that produce the best results.\nAs their blackhead removal device is a “winning product”, all the buyer will likely need to do to scale in other regions like Germany or Spanish-speaking countries is use their streamlined influencer system, recorded in several training videos and SOP documents that will be part of this acquisition. The brand’s influencer marketing team is included in the sale and can operate on autopilot.\nThe skincare market has seen a significant rise in demand through recent years, with customers picking up interest in self-care and having healthy, youthful skin even as they age. As the industry grows, so will the number of potential opportunities for this brand, putting them in a great position that the buyer can capitalize upon with the right strategies. Additionally, seller financing is available for this brand, adding to the benefits that they will offer their new owner.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents an Online Job Recruitment Firm for sale that connects employers within the Health Care Field with proficient job seekers. Their platform facilitates the hiring process for Physicians and Registered Nurses, offering employers swift access to top-tier candidates. The service has garnered significant demand since its inception, primarily due to the widespread shortage of medical professionals in all 50 states. Leveraging a seamless online platform, the company streamlines the process of posting job openings and effectively markets them to potential candidates through popular industry-specific job boards.\nBusiness Broker Takeaway\nOur analysis of this business shows that the value propositions present are strong for a first-time buyer looking to get into the online space. We are excited about this business for 3 important reasons:\nProliferating Market\nThe agency operates in the healthcare industry, one of the world’s largest and most rapidly expanding sectors, which in the US alone comprises 14% of the workforce and employs a staggering 20 million individuals. Moreover, it witnesses an immense 1.2 million job openings annually. Healthcare expenditure accounted for 18.3% of the country’s economy in 2021, generating a revenue of $4.3 trillion.\nThe persistent scarcity of physicians and nurses nationwide has intensified the demand for sophisticated job placement services capable of assisting healthcare facilities in sourcing the necessary talent. This business has adeptly developed a process to fulfill this need, yielding impressive results.\nOperations & Valuation Points\nThe agency boasts a proficient team of virtual assistants tasked with sourcing candidates through a diverse array of employment platforms. This encompasses general job recruitment sites as well as specialized platforms catering specifically to professionals in the medical field. The team strategically garners meaningful referrals by leveraging these platforms and the National Coalition of Health Care Recruiters website, effectively casting a wide net to identify top talent for its clients.\nStringent SOPs enable the company to streamline and automate the entire process, meeting the needs of both healthcare organizations and job applicants alike. They maintain active email correspondence and outreach with clients seeking to fill positions and engage with all applicants, including conducting follow-up calls to ensure sustained interest from both parties. Additionally, the agency remains proactive in reaching out to new candidates, ensuring a continuous influx of potential hires.\nThe well-established system consistently delivers favorable outcomes for both clients and candidates. Furthermore, the current ownership has significantly improved its website, transitioning it to Zoho Recruit. This upgrade provides an extensive suite of advanced tools for candidate sourcing, including an applicant tracking system. Subsequently, it has immensely facilitated the virtual assistants’ locating new applicants while reducing overall expenses.\nClients & Revenue Generation\nSince its inception, the company has been committed to providing healthcare facilities with an experienced team of Physician Recruiters, offering invaluable resources and dedicated assistance. These facilities encompass medical centers, long-term care centers, public and private hospitals, private practices, and urgent care centers. These establishments gain access to a pool of top-notch talent through the online platform, which is especially crucial when seeking candidates with specialized medical expertise.\nThe company operates on a contingency basis, initiating free search efforts until they successfully identify the ideal candidate, at which point their contracted fee comes into effect. These contingency partnerships within the healthcare industry have bolstered its reputation significantly in a sector that continues to experience rapid growth, particularly with the aging population of Baby Boomers requiring increased medical attention.\nCandidate Sourcing\nThe website is tailored to streamline the process for job seekers, allowing them to submit their applications easily. Following this, candidates are promptly engaged through targeted emails, initiating a personalized communication journey.\nBy leveraging Doccafe and NAHCR as their primary platforms for sourcing new candidates, the business can swiftly identify potential hires through a straightforward Google search. Additionally, it benefits from referrals from representatives of medical device firms, who maintain regular contact with healthcare facilities seeking expansion by recruiting new physicians. Notably, the company boasts an impressive 89% conversion rate for candidates applying to job listings via Doccafe.\nFurthermore, management is exploring avenues through LinkedIn automation software designed to aid businesses in recruiting candidates. This initiative is anticipated to enhance the agency’s visibility among doctors and nurses active on LinkedIn seeking new opportunities. Additionally, it will effectively expose the brand and its services to a broader audience of passive candidates considering embarking on a job search in the near future.\nWith minimal manual intervention required due to its highly automated nature and comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures in place, this business is primed for further growth, especially considering the escalating demand for qualified Physicians and Registered Nurses in the foreseeable future.",

        "title": "35 Year Online Ticket Brokering Company | Secondary Marketplace for Concert, Sporting Event & Theater Tickets | SBA Pre-Qualified | 80,000+ Affiliates",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a 35-year-old Ticket Brokering Business specializing in the secondary market for sought-after concerts, sporting events, and theatre seats. It has garnered a reputation of the highest caliber, built a devoted clientele, and distinguished itself from rivals through honesty, transparency, and exceptional customer support.\nThe Market\nIn recent years, the demand for sporting events, concerts, and theater tickets has surged to unprecedented levels, leading to frequent sellouts that leave enthusiasts scrambling to find seats right before the event starts. Major sports leagues such as the MLB, NFL, NHL, and NBA, along with prestigious tournaments like the World Series, Super Bowl, and Masters Golf Tournament, witness an overwhelming demand for tickets, resulting in frequent sellouts, especially of the premium seats. The anticipation surrounding these events, fueled by the fervor of dedicated fans and the allure of witnessing iconic moments, contributes to the rapid depletion of ticket inventories. As a result, individuals often turn to honest and trusted ticket resellers, like this company, to fulfill their desire to attend these highly sought-after events. These resellers play a crucial role in the secondary ticket market, offering a solution for fans who missed out on initial ticket releases or seek specific seating arrangements. The popularity of these services underscores the evolving dynamics of ticket acquisition in the face of soaring demand for live entertainment experiences.\nStandout Features\nThe company website displays between $2 and $3 billion worth of tickets at any given time. Consumers see the same tickets as other marketplaces; however, the platform differs in various ways, making it highly attractive.\nFor instance, unlike many competitors that mislead clients by hiding substantial fees, this business is transparent, listing tickets at their total all-inclusive prices. Additionally, the company has built a reputation for outstanding customer support whereas many others in the industry considerably lack in this department.\nMany consumers have called the company for nearly 36 years to gather information or advice about whether it’s a good time to buy tickets or if they should possibly wait until it gets closer to the event. This is atypical in the industry and highly appreciated. In fact, it’s challenging to speak to a customer service representative at most rival sites. Since inception, the founder has emphasized the importance of this aspect of operations. The team is accessible daily via phone, text messages, email, and Live Chat until 10 pm. They even go the extra mile by sending out reminders to clients before attending events and leaving their mobile phone numbers for emergencies.\nA key value proposition of the business is that they are the only one offering Travel Agents a dedicated opportunity to earn commission. The owners judiciously implemented an affiliate program for these professionals, whereby they each have a personalized website to send their clients and receive a percentage of the sale. This strategy has proven incredibly lucrative and contributed over $2 million in revenue in 2023. The business currently has more than 80,000 affiliates, growing by approximately 100 new agents per day.\nTicket Sourcing\nTickets are procured in various ways.\nRevenue Generation & Marketing\nThe business offers tickets to a range of events, as indicated, but enjoys excellent profitability on certain fixtures. The top-seller is The Masters Golf Tournament, which accounts for 25% of sales and achieves 35% net margins. The Super Bowl follows in popularity, contributing between 10% and 15% of annual revenue at 15% margins. $2 million is derived from sales for miscellaneous events, which presents tremendous growth potential.\nThe company allocates a minimal budget to marketing, exhibiting another potentially lucrative prospect for a buyer. The Travel Agent arm was developed through a grassroots effort to get the brand recognized in that industry and quickly morphed into a lucrative arrangement through several prominent host agents. Facebook is utilized and geared toward these agents on an exclusive affiliate page, and an agency performs additional marketing across social media platforms.\nCustomer Demographic & Staff\nThe website attracts customers worldwide, driven by the US, Canada, and Mexico. The demographic is extensive, considering tickets range from around $100 to many thousands of dollars.\nOne of the owners runs day-to-day operations, including ticket acquisitions and pricing, communication with customers, resolving issues, and all other projects.\nTwo full-time employees work in the capacities of Date Entry and Bookkeeper, and a part-time member works in Sales.\nThe team is motivated to remain post-acquisition, should a buyer wish, and the owner is willing to stay for an extended period. Subsequently, they can reap the benefits of a comfortable transition period and business relationships that have been cultivated over the course of 35 years.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a golden acquisition in the jewelry market that specializes in a wide range of vintage-inspired earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, and other accessories. Their products are highly popular due to their exclusive classical designs, fantastic quality, and beautiful look, winning them a consumer base that includes style bloggers, creative influencers, celebrity stylists, and even celebrities themselves.\nTheir 800 SKUs can be found featured in Vogue and multiple gift guides, in the wardrobes of celebrities like Fantasia Barrino, Allegra Edwards, Renee Rapp, Katy Perry and many others, and sold in boutiques and department stores such as Anthropologie, Neiman Marcus, and Henri Bendel. They have also appeared on multiple television shows, and even have a 13-year-strong relationship with a National Morning Show, with deal segments with them having driven as much as $180,000 in sales in a 72-hour timeframe: something that gives them a significant edge over competitors in their niche.\nRather than relying on a single manufacturer for their product production, the company sources their SKUs from a strong network of manufacturers based around the world. Some of these suppliers can be found in New York City and Rhode Island for domestic production, while a consultant works with the owner to have designs produced in China, Thailand, India, and Kora. They have also established direct relationships with manufacturers that provide the brand with valuable private label products, adding to the unique nature of what they have to offer.\nThe brand keeps their working capital requirements low, with inventory orders being placed after customers make a purchase. These products then arrive within a few days, and are promptly shipped out. For larger online sales events like television appearances, the company stocks all their products in advance to better meet demand, as pieces tend to sell out quickly.\nThe company sees consistently strong sales throughout the year, but as one might expect from their industry, their sales see a peak around the holidays. Their average consumer is a 35 year or older woman who responds well to promotion, is satisfied with her first purchase, and later returns to the brand to buy new pieces for her collection. As the brand’s products are shipped exclusively within the US and Canada, all their customers can be found in the North American region.\nOne of the ways that this company has shown themselves to be a diamond in the rough is their immense organic advertising flow. They gain many of their customers through referrals and celebrities, and their regular, coveted, and incredibly profitable collaborations with two major networks. The segments that these networks run lead to the brand’s pieces being showcased to nearly 3 million viewers whenever they go on air, leading to their sales skyrocketing and a reach of 48 million monthly unique visitors online. These tactics, combined with the shining quality of their products, have led to over 15,000 subscribers in their email database, a $415 Customer Lifetime Value, a $80 Average Order Value, and an impressive 51% Repeat Customer Rate.\nThe brand works with three prominent affiliate networks, who earn a 15% commission for sales made on the website. As the current owner hasn’t had the opportunity to drive affiliate traffic elsewhere, doing so would be a great strategy for the buyer to take. The show has earned over $40,000 in sales in one month alone through the affiliate program.\nThe company has worked with their PR firm for 13 years now, which is one of only two firms that the show will work with on their deal segments. These segment collaborations work on an affiliate basis, giving them a 15% share of the total revenue earned for promoting the brand’s products. From there, the PR firm takes a 10% commission as well.\nThe firm is responsible for the brand’s influencer marketing, which involves them gifting products to influencers in exchange for promotional posts. The brand holds gifting suites or these influencers in New York andLos Angelesduring certain times of the year, and as these products have a great appeal among influencers, the brand has grown to be the most popular client for the firm.\nThat isn’t all the firm does for the brand, however. The company has recently overhauled their Instagram page and profile, with the firm being placed in charge of updating and maintaining the account. This, along with updates being made to their online press and celeb pages on their website, have polished the brand and significantly enhanced their Public Relations efforts.\nThe current owner works full-time running the business, with her main responsibilities consisting of email marketing, social media, photography, graphic design, website maintenance, merchandising, product design and development, inventory management, order fulfillment, and customer service. Though the company doesn’t employ any employees outside of the owner, they do use third-party suppliers for their jewelry production.\nThe company has already taken massive strides within the last 3 months alone to bolster their brand, such as sending a stylist kit of jewelry to be included when an actress goes on a press tour for a major upcoming movie, securing 2024 spring feature articles to promote and display their products in multiple publications, and providing showroom samples in preparation for what will likely be a busy awards/awards parties season. They will also be doing more deal segments across the NBC Universal/Comcast properties, have scheduled deals on Access Hollywood and other properties.\nThe brand has begun resigning a network of wholesaler retail sellers that include major well-known jewelry stores around the US, and will soon launch their new presence on the Faire.com marketplace to reach and sell to the independent wholesale online marketplace. Additionally, as their products have been worn by David Archuleta, they have opportunities to expand into the men’s market for an even larger potential consumer base.\nThis glamorous grab is great for a buyer who knows their way around marketing. By expanding the brand’s social media presence, focusing efforts into paid marketing and SSL, and continuing to work with the PR firm to boost press, celebrity, and influencer opportunities, they can show themselves as the gem they truly are to the world.",

All contract options are paid in advance weekly, monthly, or quarterly or via custom payment plans that include a setup fee.\nCustomer Acquisition\nThe company has created a client acquisition strategy that generates a healthy mix of organic, manual, paid, direct, and referral traffic through carefully selected tactics.\nKeywords with high buying intent are prioritized for inbound traffic, with all currently active PPC keywords in campaigns exhibit a strong return on ad spend. The team has steadily shifted their reliance away from PPC to better prioritize organic traffic as they grow across the network of domains, which has reduced their advertising costs and, in turn, improved their margins.\nThis approach offers them about 50 inbound leads every day with high conversion rates thanks to structured analysis, presentation, negotiation, and closing process.\nOne of their departments begins this process with rigorous lead and deal cadence, after which another will present solutions to problems, negotiate sales, and secure payments. Finally, the client success team takes charge of the account through a meticulous customer assignment process.\nWhile this is occurring, the outbound traffic strategy targets brands and individuals facing reputation management crises or negative news cycles. Business and personal information applications are leveraged to generate contact details, initiate outreach, and elucidate how the firm can be of assistance.\nOperations\nThe brand’s average customer is typically either a company or an individual looking to improve their online reputation, with an average lifetime value of $7,110.\nThe current owner works full-time as the company’s CEO, with his primary responsibilities including recruiting, finances, marketing, and business development.\nThe brand’s day-to-day operations are skillfully handled by a workforce of 40 full-time employees led by a capable executive team.

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a unique opportunity to purchase a brand in the Nutritional Supplements space that has been in operation for over 25 years. Over the years, the company that owns this brand has worked tirelessly to develop flavors and exclusive formulas for its supplements, which are presented to the consumer in Liquid Form. Since liquid supplements are absorbed into the body at a rate of around 96%, versus roughly 18% for pill and capsule form, consumers are more interested in this product compared to the traditional pill form.\nThe issue for other liquid supplements brands has always been flavor. Many consumers understand the absorbative benefit in drinking their vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, but oftentimes cannot take the bad taste that is oftentimes present with other brands’ formulas. This company has resolved that problem and created formulas that cannot be copied by others, especially since they also own the manufacturing plant that makes all their products. With complete control of manufacturing, inventory management, and formula development, the company has withstood the test of time and become a leader on the Amazon platform for this subcategory.\nThis is proven by the company’s 50% Repeat Order Rate – an astounding achievement for any brand even in the consumable supplements space.\nThe niche market in which this brand operates reached a value of $42 billion in 2022, with projections signaling significant growth. Experts anticipate an 8% CAGR, reaching an estimated $93 billion by 2030. Several factors drive this growth, including heightened health awareness, fitness trends, and the prevalence of nutritional deficiencies.\nKPIs\nLiquid supplements thrive in a competitive overall supplement landscape with limited rivals. The intricate manufacturing process, which this company owns and operates, and the challenge of perfecting taste, create hurdles for potential competitors, paving the way for this brand’s success. This is a huge defensive moat that cannot be overlooked by potential suitors.\nAs noted, the business has its own manufacturing facility. While the manufacturing arm isn’t up for sale as part of this transaction (since it also provides products for other brands), it presents considerable advantages to a potential buyer, who will receive best in class, guaranteed pricing, have the option to develop new products at super low upfront costs, and control their own destiny as it relates to inventory management. Upon acquisition, the new owner will gain control over the process, ensuring product quality and stability. Furthermore, agreed-upon product costs remain steady, guarding against unexpected price fluctuations.\nOver time, management has accumulated invaluable assets like videos, testimonials, and marketing materials that can be used to more fully develop the company’s growth plan. These resources offer a platform for expanding the brand, setting the stage for significant growth.\nRevenue Generation\nThe company embarked on its journey many years ago and has adapted consistently and shrewdly, now successfully selling products on Amazon and through a Shopify-built website. Their range encompasses diverse multivitamins and supplements targeting various health concerns, such as bone strength, weight loss, vision, brain function, and hair, skin, and nail health.\nThey boast a portfolio of 28 popular SKUs that are exclusively branded. Achieving an average order value of $65 across the range, no single product dominates sales. Top performers include multivitamins tailored for children, women, and men.\nSales maintain strength year-round, experiencing a spike around the New Year due to health-focused resolutions. The typical customer is a woman aged 40 or older who often orders multiple products to meet her family’s wellness needs.\nWhile the website drives strong sales, Amazon generates 70% of revenue. Factors like efficient shipping through FBA and maintaining three months’ inventory contribute to this robust presence.\nThe brand’s success on Amazon is bolstered by highly positive customer reviews, fostering authenticity among potential buyers. Besides direct-to-consumer sales, approximately 10% of revenue comes from major retail distributors, a segment with promising growth due to the expanding health and beauty sectors.\nAdvertising & Acquisition\nMarketing plays a pivotal role, which is evident from the over 16,000 unique monthly visitors to the website. Ads on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Google complement this organic traffic.\nInvestment in SEO, emphasizing backlinks and a keyword-focused blog, enhances search engine rankings and website traffic. Leveraging an email database of over 60,000 subscribers aids in product promotion, and an active social media presence fosters a loyal customer community.\nEfficient daily operations managed by an experienced team, including a full-time Amazon manager and two in-house sales managers, form a significant benefit for potential buyers. The current owners focus primarily on inventory management and overseeing the proficient team.\nThis is a unique opportunity to invest in a well-established eCommerce brand in a thriving niche—the minimal competition, manufacturing control, and influential marketing position it for future accomplishment.\nThe sellers are open to a flexible transaction structure, aiming to retain between 20% and 30% equity. This demonstrates their belief in the business and commitment to exponential growth with strategic partners. Their ownership of the manufacturing arm ensures continued involvement, guaranteeing smooth operations, stable pricing, and efficient order processing.",

The Company’s unique approach to recruiting allows their clients to share in the success of the changing recruitment landscape by growing and fulfilling their own specific recruitment needs.\nWorkload & Team\nThe two owners dedicate approximately 10 hours weekly to the business. One is focused primarily on managing the sales team, while the other handles finances and operations.\nTwo key staff members are valuable assets:\nOne is an expert in recruiting and staffing sales organizations. She has over 13 years of direct sales, marketing, and recruiting consulting experience and has personally screened and interviewed over 4,000 applicants. She has also hired, trained, and launched more than 1,000 sales representatives throughout her career.\nShe brings the most value by working individually with her clients to help them shift their mindset and beliefs around recruiting and their organization’s potential, helping them better understand how to monitor the entire recruiting process from initial phone calls to training and onboarding.\nThe other is a seasoned professional with extensive experience in venture capital deals. He has worked in the private equity space, specializing in funding late-stage venture capital deals for accredited investors. Currently, as the face of the company, he empowers businesses with organic recruitment strategies to efficiently expand their teams with top-tier sales representatives. He sources, schedules, and closes sales for the company while also managing its setters.\nHis journey in sales and recruiting began at an industry-leading firm, where he recruited an impressive 10,000 representatives over eight years. During this time, he conceived and honed organic recruitment techniques that would later be adopted nationwide, resulting in the recruitment of over 40,000 sales reps annually. Further expertise extends to helping over 50 companies implement these proven methods, allowing them to prioritize quality over quantity in their recruitment efforts.\nMarketing & Scale\nThe primary source of traffic referrals is via Instagram. By percentage, 70% is organic, 20% is inorganic, and 10% is referral.\nOther efforts include posting regular content on a noteworthy online site and sending voice memos to prospects through DMs to start a conversation, leading them to schedule a call.\nSignificant potential exists to scale the business through additional marketing. Although events will always be a large source of revenue, advertising on a broader range of platforms and implementing email campaigns will allow this program to scale heavily.\nEnticingly, few special skills are required of a buyer that the existing owners cannot teach them during the transition period. A basic understanding of psychology and comprehension is all that is necessary. Management has created detailed videos and SOPs to facilitate the process further.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents an SBA Pre-Approved eCommerce Brand that is a veteran in the Custom Art Niche, having painted a path to success throughout the 22 years since they made their start in the market. They specialize in the sale of personalized and framed art paintings and monogrammed wall art, giving their customers a lovely, customized touch to their walls, and giving them strong, stable sales and cash flow.\nSBA Pre-Qualified\nGiven how long the company has been in business, as well as it’s current trending, we have run the financials by our lending partners and received a pre-qualification status of this deal through the Small Business Administration (SBA). With an SBA loan, a Qualified Buyer can buy the assets of this company with as little as 10% down, amortized over an entire decade. SBA loans tend to have the lowest interest rates in the market for business acquisitions. With 10 years to pay down debt service, buyers can achieve an ROI on their initial investment with 1-2 years.\nThe Company\n99% of their product roster is copyrighted and proprietary, protecting their brand in the niche custom art category and reducing the competition that they face. They also have a custom developed configurator for their website and Walmart listings that make it possible for customers to personalize their pieces to their liking. This configurator lets them pick photos for each letter and background, making purchases of their topselling name art as exclusive as the customer wants them to be.\nThey offer over 100 unique personalized prints spread across thousands of individual SKUs and have more in development. They also have over 220 parent level products on Amazon. This lets this company cover a wide range of subjects and styles to appeal to a broader audience and gives their products a reputation for being great giftable items.\nMost of their sales are custom art pieces made for special occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, and Christmas, with these exclusive prints being personalized to include names and important dates for each customer.\nSince their launch in 2000, the company has enjoyed significant growth, with their reputation for high quality products created in-house fueling their success. They initially started through wholesale by working with print catalog companies to DropShip their products, then, as they’ve grown, partnered with larger retailers such as Bass Pro, Walmart, and Kohls, as well as many others.\nThey’ve focused more on DTC sales throughout the past 7 years through their website, Amazon, and Etsy, and have recently incorporated Walmart’s online storefront to their online sales channels. The strength of their products, coupled with their appeal in the gift market, have given the brand over 15,000 5 Star reviews.\nTheir work on their DTC sales hasn’t detracted from the B2B side of their business, with the company continuing to create exclusive artwork for wholesalers. Some of these works are exclusive to individual wholesalers, while others are offered to numerous retailers. The brand then processes the orders, creates the products on demand, and ships to the customer within 2 business days.\nTheir Average Order Value for their DTC sales sits at $87.50, while their wholesale AOV is $29.20. Their nature as a gift-centric brand means that their B2B sales spike during holidays such as Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, the wedding season, and so on. Their retail customers also drive promotions and catalogs for their products, further boosting their sales.\nToday, 49.8% of their sales are on Amazon, 34.5% are through the internet, and the rest are made through wholesale.\nMarketing\nThe brand primarily uses PPC and social media ads to generate traffic, which they supplement with an SEO program, content creation, and email marketing efforts. Their SEO campaign involves a blog run on their website, while their email marketing strategy utilizes the over 190,000 subscribers in their database- 95% of which have completed purchases from the company.\nThey test new products and designs with the help of their engaged customer base, and regularly make posts on social media featuring their art to help drive their organic traffic. These combined marketing efforts have led to over 150,000 monthly sessions during gifting seasons on both Amazon and their own website.\nTheir knowledge of how to reach both DTC and B2B customers means that they have a canvas rich with opportunity laid before them. These opportunities include utilizing bulk product wholesale requests from their retail partners rather than focusing mostly on personalization, updating their website to improve the customer experience, and expanding SKUs to include complementary products. The company is already working to incorporate all three of these strategies, putting them in a great position for a buyer to take over.\nHuman Resources\nThe company has a large team that manages much of the brand’s workload, consisting of a full-time creative lead, customer manager, customer service manager, warehouse manager, production manager and shipping supervisor. They receive up to 75 customer inquiries every day, and ship out 100 to 1,200 orders, depending on the season. To meet demand, they keep 4 to 6 months of inventory on hand at all times.\nThis acquisition is a work of art, having been painted over the two decades since they first came into play.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a Women’s Apparel eCommerce Brand with a decade of experience marketing their trademarked, branded line of Women’s Basics on both their website and Amazon. From the start, the company has performed exceptionally well by developing a research system that tracks which women’s apparel products are trending, and what the best-sellers are on Amazon.  The data they gather is used to design products the company knows their customers are looking for and buying.\nThe result has been a phenomenal 100% revenue growth since 2022, as well as 200% seller discretionary earnings growth and tens of thousands of products reviews on Amazon.com. The company has created a proven method for creating products that their audience loves and that drive sales higher.\nWhile the company sells women’s everyday apparel with a timeless look and style, it developed a highly profitable niche by marketing 3-packs to customers. Once the company sees which of their products are trending, they combine them into 3-packs.    Customers love the savings they get on shipping costs, and at the same time, this increases the company’s profit margins by reducing the number of SKUs they need to maintain.\nTheir products are made in the U.S. and fully trademarked. In fact, the company now has 22 patented SKUs, which sell for an Average Order Value of $41.\nAmazon has proven to be a strong sales platform for them. Using PPC ad campaigns on Amazon, the company has been able to attract a growing customer base, and 99% of their orders are shipped through Fulfillment By Amazon, giving the company a strong reputation for good customer service and fast deliveries.\nThe company also receives thousands of highly enthusiastic customer reviews, giving them a tremendous 99% Seller Rating on the site. While the vast majority of the company’s sales are on Amazon, they have expanded their sales channels and now have a rising percentage of sales on their website and Walmart.\nAs women’s clothing remains one of our most evergreen and profitable industries, the company’s ability to spot and capitalize on trends within this niche space has served them exceedingly well. While short-sleeved and long-sleeved products tend to generate higher sales at specific times of the year, overall the company’s sales are not impacted by seasonality. Their sales do peak around the holidays and again at the start of the new year.\nProducts\nThe company’s products are cited for a soft, smooth feel on the skin, and a high quality matched with by great value. Their product reviews on Amazon feature glowing accounts from customers about how flattering their shirts look, with praise for the savings and value their 3-packs offer. The brand’s multipack women’s t-shirts are available in both small to plus sizes and offer the perfect look as either business or casual attire.\nAdditional products include quality ladies’ tops and blouses that are easy to match or pair with pants, jeans, slacks, shorts, leggings, blazers, or skirts. This flexibility, matched with the savings provided through their 3-packs, has given the company an increasingly loyal customer base.\nTo keep up with demand, the company maintains inventory in their own warehouse which is sent to FBA as orders come in, and they generally maintain six months’ worth of inventory at all times. New orders to their suppliers are placed every six months.\nTheir warehouse is also where the company inspects each new inventory shipment they receive and prepares and sends them to FBA. The company is now shipping up to 10 packages daily.\nOperations\nWith so many key functions being handled by Amazon, the company is very turnkey and does not require a heavy workload from the current ownership.  There are six full-time employees who oversee the company’s warehouse, supply chain, PPC campaigns, and Amazon listings, and a virtual assistant managing daily tasks. As a result, the current owner works as little as 5 hours per week on this business.\nTheir team is experienced, highly efficient, and motivated to stay on post-acquisition.\nThe company uses suppliers based in the U.S. who manufacture their products. Their supply chain has also become more efficient recently, so the company is now importing some inventory from China and Vietnam as well.\nAll their 22 SKUs are manufactured directly for this company and sold under their brand name.\nIn addition to PPC ads on Amazon, the company relies on its SEO program to market their SKUs. The SEO program determines the best keywords to use to get their products in front of shoppers visiting their sales platform.\nThe company has numerous paths to grow this business, including by launching a PPC ad campaign on Facebook, introducing new products for upsells and cross-sells, expanding into men’s clothing lines, and launching an international expansion on Amazon’s foreign platforms.\nThe company could also begin targeting wholesale and retail accounts, marketing their products directly to businesses that sell women’s apparel and are looking for unique new styles.\nA buyer has the opportunity to take over a thriving company in one of our most profitable fields. With a minimal workload needed and so many of the business’ functions handled by Amazon, a buyer can focus on scaling this already profitable operation and sending profits skyrocketing.\nThe fact that the company’s SKUs are unique and manufactured directly for this business gives the owner an opportunity to build successfully on the brand’s loyal following.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a Recurring Revenue based eCommerce Brand that has become a popular Subscription Service for Fitness Products from some of the top brands in the lucrative world of Fitness Apparel, Gear, Accessories, and Nutrition. Paying subscribers receive a curated selection of 5-8 products delivered to their door on a monthly basis. The Brand’s modern website also has the option for users to buy individual fitness items. The company has spent nearly a decade attracting a loyal customer base for its subscription boxes, which are now 65% of all sales (with the balance made up of individual, one-off sales).\nFor investors, this is a terrific opportunity to take advantage of the Loyal Customer Base this company has built up over time. Interesting suitors might be those that currently operate in the eCommerce Fitness Vertical and looking for additional channels to offer their brand(s), those that connect with a Fitness Audience that might be interested in the beautiful subscription boxes offered by this company, or any other entrepreneur or group that is looking to get into eCommerce and learn the ropes from ownership.\nThe company markets individual products on its Branded Website and on Amazon, so an investor has the option of focusing on growing the brand’s subscription box business, targeting increased DTC sales of products sold individually, or both.\nThis company could be successfully scaled into two separate businesses, both with the potential for sky-high revenue since their customers have been resilient in the face of rising inflation or interest rate increases, giving the company not only higher sales, but also an impressive 62% Repeat Customer Rate.\nThis brand wisely recognized that subscription-based models have become increasingly popular today, both among customers and eCommerce businesses, especially since folks are always looking for gift ideas for their loved ones … and, the overall fitness industry has exploded, so the audience is larger, giving a buyer of this company the opportunity to grow into market share through various other strategies.\nOnce customers find a product they like and decide to continue purchasing it, subscriptions offer fast and reliable deliveries. For the business, it means a higher customer satisfaction level and a steady revenue stream. That’s exactly what this business is now enjoying as the company’s Average Subscription Rate is 16.84 Months\nLaunched in 2016, the company cultivated relationships with other brands to assemble appealing products for their monthly subscription boxes, designed to give fitness buffs everything they need for an enjoyable and invigorating workout, whether it’s at a gym, at home, or in a class. While these boxes now make up 65% of their revenue, the rest comes from Amazon and their Website.\nTheir subscriptions are available for one, three, and six-month plans (although many customers opt for longer) and they have 50 SKUs available. While most of its SKUs are not brand products, the company has requested exclusive designs and colorways for certain products provided by its suppliers, giving the company an opportunity to resell these items with limited competition and to build on its brand awareness campaign.\nWith an Average Order Value of $55, their sales remain steady thanks to their subscriptions, while the company enjoys sharp spikes in profits around the holidays (when their SKUs become great gift items), and again at the start of the new year when millions make resolutions to get back in shape.\nTheir customer demographics are strong, with the average customer being around age 35 with an interest in CrossFit and other intense forms of athletics. More impressively, the company appeals to high-wage earners who love spending their disposable income on these products because they believe they’re getting a deal. Because so many keep their subscriptions long-term, the company’s Lifetime Customer Value is considerably elevated at $900.\nSocial media has served the brand well as they’ve grown their core audience, giving them the ability to connect with thousands of fitness enthusiasts across the country and introduce their products to them.\nWith a large following on Facebook of 24,000+ and an additional 38,900+ followers on Instagram, their content strategy enables the brand to connect with people interested in fitness and who are looking for products that enhance their workouts. The company also runs PPC ads on Facebook and has a Facebook group that has been a great tool for communicating with fitness-minded viewers.\nThey also generate organic traffic through their SEO program which fully optimizes their website for top industry keywords and includes an informative blog on the site. These have proven to be effective tools, giving the company 10,000+ unique monthly visitors to the site.\nTheir marketing also includes providing a free gift with their first subscription box to encourage buyers to continue their subscriptions for longer periods of time.\nAdditional tools are available, including taking full advantage of the 40,000 subscribers in their email database for a regular email newsletter for promotions, special deals, and upsells, launching an SMS text messaging campaign, and using influencers on their social media accounts to expand their customer base even further and build up their brand recognition\nThe brand’s orders are processed through a partnership with a sub-box fulfillment service that ships their monthly orders. Their Amazon orders and individual items are either shipped through Fulfillment by Amazon or by their brand partners. Excess inventory is maintained for their online store, with the company keeping several hundred of each SKU to keep up with new orders. That inventory is stocked in a 1,500-square-foot warehouse, with inventory managed by their Shopify account.\nThese operations run so smoothly that the current ownership does not have any full-time employees, but still only works about 20 hours per week, focusing on curating the boxes for shipment, handling customer service, and launching promotions.\nVirtual assistants are used for email marketing and to handle social media posts. Additional VAs could be brought on to take over additional daily tasks.\nAfter seven years, this brand is in an enviable position, with a loyal and enthusiastic customer base, steady recurring revenues that peak in the 4th Quarter, and some impressive scale opportunities moving forward. The company is now looking for an investor who can bring a fresh perspective and new energy to this business and help scale it to a much more profitable position. The tools are there for an investor to take advantage of.\nAs their subscription rates get higher, the revenue will continue flowing in as the new owner takes advantage of serious growth opportunities within the booming fields of fitness gear and subscription plans.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents an SBA Pre-Qualified eLearning Business that provides instruction in the Web Development & Programming Verticals. The company has benefited from its long-standing presence in these sectors and was well-positioned to meet the surging demand for digital skills when the global pandemic struck. Well beyond the pandemic now, they continue to do exceptionally well at training people that are interested in this important sector and have lost no steam.\nWhat does this mean for the discerning buyer? Notably, the company is very strong financially, which has allowed it to be pre-approved with our Lending Partners. Our Lending Partners work in the digital sector and have a portfolio of underwritten deals that match this business. It is important to always use lenders that have knowledge of a particular space as well as the brokers they are working with – not all business brokers are alike.\nWith an SBA 7(a) loan, this business can be purchased by a Qualified Buyer with as little as 10% down, amortized over an entire 10-year period … all at industry low interest rates. This helps buyers that use this lending vehicle achieve an ROI on their down payment very quickly while freeing up cash flow for expansion or other endeavors.\nHere’s the most exciting thing about this company – they require zero paid advertising in order to generate sales … that’s right – zero! With no active use of paid advertising, management’s primary customer acquisition strategy centers around YouTube. The majority of sales are driven by their highly influential channel, which has garnered substantial organic traffic and engagement. With impressive metrics, including 2.11 million subscribers, up to 1.6 million monthly visitors and 15,000 new subscribers each month, the channel is a powerhouse for promoting the eLearning courses and converting prospects.\nThe channel isn’t just about one person – it benefits from 47 guest contributors, further diversifying content and expertise, and boasts a top-three all-time contributor position within the niche.\nMultiple channels are employed to offer the training courses. The primary sales channel, Udemy, has been a substantial source of revenue and student engagement. More than 444,000 students have enrolled, demonstrating the quality and demand for the material. These courses comprise an impressive selection of approximately 15 offerings, each designed to meet the diverse needs of learners in the web development and programming niche.\nUdemy’s revenue-sharing model plays a pivotal role in earnings. When students visit the platform through a personal link, the company receives 97% of the revenue from course sales. Alternatively, if students discover the courses by searching the Udemy website, the company obtains 37%. This highlights the potential of effective marketing and promotion outside the Udemy platform to maximize profits and increase sales.\nThe pricing strategy on Udemy is aligned with the platform’s pricing structure, where courses typically range from $15 to $25. Some of this company’s training material is exceptionally comprehensive, spanning 10 to 20 hours of content. It’s worth considering whether course duration and pricing adjustments should be made to better reflect the value provided and immediately boost bottom-line growth. These courses have generated consistent monthly earnings of $30,000 to $60,000, yet there may be room for optimizing the pricing strategy to increase overall revenue. Tens of thousands of glowing reviews and an exceptional reputation would minimize the impact of price increases on sales.\nA more recent sales channel growing traction quickly is the company’s official website, a bustling hub receiving 30,000 monthly organic visitors. This high level of no-cost traffic serves as a testament to the company’s reputation and effective click-through rate on YouTube. It provides a diverse range of 13 courses and an eBook, available individually or as monthly and annual subscriptions. This has resulted in a new, recurring revenue stream of tremendous value. Since February 2023, it has successfully onboarded 6,000 new students, showcasing an ability to attract and convert prospective learners.\nCustomers are incentivized to purchase through the website, where they receive added value akin to traditional documentation in the form of comprehensive, book-like resources. Lastly, management collaborates with a publishing company to list all courses on various educational platforms, requiring minimal effort.\nThe owner develops a course approximately every 3 to 4 months, serving as the sole instructor and creator. However, with the introduction of a proficient team, this rate could be significantly increased, potentially leading to a 400% boost in profits.\nThe typical customer consists of individuals aspiring to become web developers, with a significant portion falling within the age range of 18 to 34. Their core characteristic is their status as beginners to intermediate learners in web development. They find a strong resonance with the teaching style employed by the founder, which focuses on delivering content in a relatable and accessible manner. There is great potential to introduce advanced courses.\nThe owner works full-time and focuses primarily on the following:\nThe business has a dedicated team of three additional contractors. A part-time assistant handles customer support and inquiries across various channels. An SEO specialist actively works to enhance the company’s online presence, and a third contractor is responsible for maintaining and optimizing the website.\nNotably, the business is SBA-pre-qualified, offering prospective buyers the opportunity to acquire the company with a minimal down payment, providing additional capital to expand the team and scale quickly.\nThe current owner is willing to continue in an advisory capacity and commit to creating two new courses annually. With an excellent reputation, strong financials, and numerous avenues for growth, this business is poised for remarkable profitability and expansion under a motivated new leader.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a unique opportunity to acquire a Growth Oriented, Middle Market Nutritional Supplements Brand that has become one of the world’s leading suppliers of health products—well-known for their scientifically backed supplements that help reduce or even reverse the impacts of aging on humans.\nBiohacking, also known as human enhancement, is the process health-conscious people use in making incremental changes to their bodies, diet, and lifestyle to improve their health and well-being. Biohacking ranges from efforts to improve brain function to faster weight loss.\nSince the global pandemic, the emphasis on health, wellness, and a strong immune system has come into focus globally, and combined with breakthrough anti-aging science, has created a new super- category of supplementation that is already colossal with limitless growth potential.\nThe anti-aging market is expected to be worth $421 Billion by 2030 and is one of the fastest-growing verticals in the world. Its popularity is unsurprising, as supplements can now help tangibly reverse people’s biological age, and as the news spreads, so does the enthusiasm and sales volume. This brand entered the sector like a wrecking ball and is enjoying fruitful results beyond conceivable projections. It is at the forefront of a tremendously exciting future.\nRevenue has grown steadily over the past 3 years, and despite this aggressive growth, the company has still maintained impressive 60% net margins, which is unheard of in the Supplements Industry as a whole. Much of this stems from the company’s Average Order Value of $520, which shows that consumers are willing to pay a premium for the opportunity to potentially extend length of their life. And this $520 is not a onetime expense – they also average a 60% Repeat Order Rate, which is an unprecedented level of Recurring Revenue for a Health Company.\nSales are 100% direct-to-consumer and made either as a one-time purchase or on a subscription model, with the latter patently triggering repeat customers and annual recurring revenue. The company averages around 1 Million visitors to the site every month.\n6,800 subscription customers account for $5 million in annual recurring revenue, reducing customer acquisition costs, extending the average lifetime value of a customer, and further contributing toward the bottom line. The combination of lower churn, high margins and AOV make this a very special business that is a unicorn within its industry.\nProducts are selected based on a combination of scientific literature—typically translated into Layman’s terms by highly qualified medical and scientific professionals, independent advice from an advisory board, and feedback from creators and customers. As a result, demand for all SKUs is substantial, as sales metrics attest. The company takes a particular interest in the Science behind the ingredients they use in their products. They have developed an impressive array of research and made it available to the public so that users of their products can rest easy knowing that the products they are putting into their body actually make a difference.\nThe founder has cultivated excellent relationships with primary suppliers and copackers, who have proven trustworthy sources and fantastic partners. Many frogs were kissed before finding them, providing new ownership with yet another valuable asset.\nOnce manufactured, all products are tested at the source and again by US Labs. Only GMP facilities are utilized, ensuring optimal quality and consistency.\nThe trademarked brand sells under its private label with a few exceptions and offers some proprietary formulations, in addition to its pure, single ingredient supplements. They sell to a global audience, driven by the US market, which accounts for 70% of sales. These orders, of between 250 and 300 daily, are primarily dispatched from the company’s 4,000-square-foot warehouse and office space in the UK, and the balance are shipped from the company’s EU based 3PL.\nA US manufacturer is already up and running and the business is currently testing a US based 3PL in the country, which at current volume, will save around $90,000 in monthly delivery costs to North America while lowering minimum orders and improving speed of delivery for US customers. Inventory for European distribution is sent to a 3PL from the same company in the Netherlands. However, management is looking to begin migrating UK manufacturing to Europe to reduce costs and refine logistics in a similar fashion.\nDespite minimal marketing, the website attracts 1 million monthly visitors, with the majority of customers acquired organically through word-of-mouth referrals. Over the past few months, management has launched a paid advertising strategy that is yielding quick, positive results and a new ownership has infinite potential to pursue an aggressive digital marketing strategy and boost sales dramatically.\nExisting efforts comprise three primary avenues:\nThe typical customers are 45 or older, primarily from North America, and evenly split between genders.

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a Lead Generation Website that offers detailed Healthcare Information on sensitive topics in an unbiased fashion. The aim is to direct users to testing centers in their locations and earn commissions from the referrals. Due to the nature of the information provided, the company is highly recession resilient.\nCore offerings include a comprehensive 10-Test Panel, enabling users to get a holistic evaluation of their sexual health, and individual STD tests for those seeking specific information. In addition to these fundamental services, the company also provides an optional Early HIV Detection add-on.\nThe marketing strategy centers around organic traffic. Generating high-quality content and presenting users with listings of nearby clinics facilitates their search for testing facilities, drawing them to the site and aiding them in achieving their objectives.\nRevenue Generation\nThe business generates commissions on leads generated through two primary methods: Phone and Online.\nOnline, users visit a dedicated page to receive valuable insights differentiating between private and public options. While online, they then are able to explore nearby testing locations, clicking through to the chosen facility’s website to review pricing and proceed with their test booking directly. If the selected testing site is a private facility, users are directed through a unique affiliate tracking link, and the company earns a commission when a successful transaction takes place.\nThe phone channel follows a similar pattern, with users dialing the company’s contact number to make a booking. A company agent subsequently dispatches an SMS or email containing a unique tracking link, complete with the caller’s ticket number. In this manner, commissions are also earned.\nManagement collaborates with two key service partners, redirecting visitors to these partners’ platforms for checkout and facilitating the testing process at a conveniently located laboratory.\nValue Propositions\nThis company offers a range of compelling value propositions that make it an attractive investment opportunity. It boasts a light workload, with the current owners dedicating only 5 to 10 hours weekly to its management. With minimal incremental effort, buyers can seamlessly take over operations, especially with the option to work alongside the existing team of proficient independent contractors if desired.\nIn addition, the business boasts low fixed costs, primarily revolving around hosting and subscription-based software. This structure enhances financial stability and predictability. Moreover, customer acquisition costs are minimal, as much of the expenditure related to attracting organic traffic, such as creating high-quality curated content, has already been incurred. The result is high net margins of approximately 75%. Despite operating in a high-competition space, management astutely reaps the rewards with a high revenue-per-user for each website visit.\nWith a foundation built on organic traffic, the website demonstrates resilience to Google algorithm changes, a testament to its organic strength. Its vast volume of pages with human-written content developed over the years ensures diversity and robustness. The website even outperforms established brands in many cities, showcasing its authority.\nCompany Assets\nA prospective buyer will acquire a valuable array of assets, each contributing to its appeal and potential for growth. Firstly, they will gain ownership of a high-traffic website that serves as a beacon for individuals needing immediate STD testing services. This steady stream of visitors typically needs urgent attention, making it a prime platform for connecting users to testing facilities swiftly and efficiently.\nAdditionally, the buyer will inherit a well-oiled sales funnel mechanism capable of directing traffic toward conversions on any website offering these medical testing services.\nOne of the most substantial benefits is the extensive investment made in content over nine years, involving hundreds of human writers with diverse skill sets. This treasure trove of high-quality content adds immense value by providing users with reliable, unbiased information. The material has been meticulously crafted to cater to users’ needs for credible information, offering a resource of unparalleled depth and breadth.\nThe acquisition also includes an impressive portfolio of over 5,200 location pages spanning the entire United States, meticulously designed to meet Google’s on-page SEO guidelines. This strategic approach results in organic traffic from all 50 states, reflecting Google’s favorability towards the website.\nFurthermore, a new owner will have access to informational medical content written and vetted by practicing medical doctors, instilling trust and credibility in the information provided. This authoritative content ensures that users can rely on the website as a source of accurate and dependable medical knowledge.\nFurther benefits include a high-converting, cost-effective, and easily manageable call center operation. Equipped with call scripts, detailed documentation, and a proficient team, it has the capacity to handle a significantly greater volume of calls, offering substantial potential for scaling up and enhancing customer service.\nThis business possesses an evergreen quality that presents lucrative opportunities for a diverse range of potential buyers. Its enduring nature stems from the perennial demand for STD testing services and the website’s robust foundation.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a dynamic eLearning, Subscription Based Business that equips clients with all the tools necessary to build a career as an eCommerce Entrepreneur of Drop Shipped products. They specialize in providing online courses to teach subscribers how to build a carrier in DropShipping, Access to Thousands of Products, a Product Research Team, and Additional Resources to help the user be successful without having to play a guessing game.  The business acts as a “home base” for everything related to DropShipping, providing services for anyone, regardless of experience.\nThe pandemic spurred a global movement, increasing awareness of online shopping, especially among consumers. This led to a growing interest in remote work and supplementary income generation. Therefore, the desire to venture into eCommerce entrepreneurship surged. However, many of those attracted to this idea lack industry expertise.\nThe founder of this company astutely recognized the rising demand and online fascination with DropShipping due to its appeal as a feasible path to financial independence for individuals of all income demographics. Subsequently, the business was established. Unlike many competitors who provide tools to launch online stores but leave clients overwhelmed with maintenance complexities, this brand offers comprehensive support at every stage of the eCommerce journey, simultaneously monetizing these steps.\nInitially, the sole offering was a developed Shopify store prototype, complete with carefully selected products that users could immediately start selling through DropShipping. Over time, management evolved to provide a solution that serves as a true “one-stop-shop” for eCommerce education and resources.\nRevenue Streams\nFor a monthly fee of $19, customers gain access to a selection of pre-built Shopify store templates, offering a range of customization options in various niches and color schemes. These stores are thoughtfully equipped with winning product ideas and seamlessly integrated with a fulfillment provider capable of private labeling and automatically processing customer orders. In addition, the team introduces 12 new trending and high-demand products each week, recommended to subscribers for inclusion on their websites. As an affiliate of the provider, the company earns a commission for each of its subscribers.\nMembers also enjoy exclusive access to a portal featuring a wide array of video courses delivered by successful DropShippers. These courses cover a broad spectrum of topics, from optimizing Shopify stores to implementing organic website traffic strategies through TikTok marketing. This supplementary material serves as an additional source of income for the company.\nA substantial portion of monthly revenue is derived from commissions offered by Shopify itself. The multinational eCommerce giant provides attractive rebates for every customer who signs up for a paid plan through the company’s affiliate link. Furthermore, the company earns commissions for various other services required by customers to launch their businesses, such as AI-powered logo apps, thus diversifying its income streams. Sales remain strong, unaffected by seasonal fluctuations, and have consistently demonstrated growth.\nExpanding this portfolio of affiliate services offered to customers presents a viable opportunity for immediate growth, requiring minimal cost and effort.\nNotably, management is currently finalizing a comprehensive automation package designed to handle tasks such as product landing page creation, product ad testing, and complete ad management for clients. This service is set to launch at a starting rate of $997 per month, with all necessary systems already in place as the business prepares to roll out the corresponding funnels.\nMarketing & Customer Base\nTraffic is currently driven by paid TikTok advertising, strategically targeting individuals interested in topics like DropShipping, eCommerce, Shopify, reselling, and entrepreneurship. The team has also begun to explore and expand its presence on Facebook, with plans to scale operations on the platform further. Substantial untapped potential lies in user-generated content across all platforms, particularly on YouTube. Investing in SEO and Google Ads will likely yield highly lucrative results.\nThe typical customer profile consists of individuals already familiar with DropShipping, often through exposure to related content on their social media feeds. However, they may be uncertain about initiating their own venture or perceive the prospect of starting a business as unattainable. Others have previously attempted DropShipping but did not experience immediate success, leading them to abandon their efforts. In essence, prospective clients encompass individuals dissatisfied with their current financial situation and those who possess funds they are eager to invest in launching their own business.\nOperations & Transition\nThe business generates healthy profits and cash flow, necessitating minimal working capital from a potential buyer to maintain its current positive trajectory. Key expenses predominantly revolve around social media advertising, website and backend hosting, and contractor fees.\nRemarkably, the owner dedicates only 7 hours weekly to the company, given the streamlined systems that have been implemented. His responsibilities primarily include brief daily check-ins and weekly meetings with the contractor team through Slack and Zoom, as well as periodic monitoring of advertising metrics. Additionally, he is currently designing the funnels for the high-ticket upcoming subscription, although this task could be readily outsourced. Furthermore, the owner plays a role in selecting the “winning” products to offer customers each week, but procedures are in motion to have this automated.\nNotably, the company operates without any full-time employees. Instead, an agency handles all aspects related to virtual assistants, social media marketing, and email and SMS communication flows.\nGiven the highly automated and systematized nature of operations and the proficient team of contractors already in place, few specialized skills are demanded of a buyer. Basic knowledge of Shopify and TikTok advertising is essentially all that is required to seamlessly transition into a management role and enjoy ongoing success and impressive growth.",

        "title": "B2B eCommerce Brand in the Trucking Cargo Securement Vertical – 25% Repeat Orders – Strong YOY Growth – $1000 AOV",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a Vehicle Accessories company that has built up a thriving B2B base within the rapidly expanding trucking industry. With trucks federally mandated to keep their cargo space secure, this brand has found a highly receptive market for its specialized equipment designed to secure cargo being transported by trucks.\nHaving enjoyed a rapid increase in profits in the past year and with a rising 25% Repeat Customer Rate, the company is doing exceptionally well in this niche vertical, selling both to trucking companies, individual truck owners, self-employed truck drivers, and retailers that stock products specifically for the trucking industry. With an Average Order Value of $1,000 and 17 SKUs, the company could experience phenomenal growth by adding to its current catalog, making new products available for upsells and cross sells, and expanding into technologically innovative products that competitors are not offering.\nOne reason this is such a fast-growing business is that the truck industry is such a vital part of the U.S. economy, with 80% of U.S. commodities now relying on trucks for delivery of common goods and products that consumers buy regularly, helping the trucking industry to earn $875 billion in revenue in 2021.\nJust as truck operators need to move on packed highways and during adverse weather conditions, cargo safety has become a major issue for them, and this business was able to accurately recognize the growing need for specialized parts that help trucking companies meet federal safety guidelines. That includes the requirements of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which mandates the use of proper cargo securement to prevent damage to items the truck is carrying and to promote the truck’s safety on the road.\nThis is a growing trend across the industry and one this company wisely capitalized on. As the trucking industry shifts into high gear to meet those federal rules, this company has enormous potential to scale rapidly by increasing the range of its products to literally sell everything related to trucking and cargo safety, including a long list of parts and accessories built for trucks and trailers.\nThere are additional ways for the company to scale since the foundation is there for both increased brand recognition and skyrocketing new revenue.\nThe company operates entirely online through its Shopify website, sourcing its products directly from manufacturers in the U.S. and other countries. All products are sold under their brand name and have the company name printed on them.\nTheir products are specifically designed to help trucks maintain federally mandated safety rules, ranging from flatbed tarps to chain binders, ratchet straps, coil racks, and thick blankets for load protection and cover. The company owns all tools used to manufacture them.\nA key aspect of the company’s appeal has been their competitive pricing and the attention given to customer service. They provide high-quality products at a good price, and with a fast delivery, giving them a strong enough reputation within this industry that they now benefit from word-of-mouth referrals from one trucking business to another.\nCustomers have also started to recognize their brand name on certain products, leading them to seek out the company’s website for their own needs. They now serve a wide range of customers within the larger trucking industry, including over-the-road trucking, long-haul trucking, local businesses and self-employed truck drivers, and shops that cater to the needs of this large industry.\nSales have increased sharply since inception.\nThe company stocks 100% of its products, shipping them from its 1,500- square-foot warehouse. Inventory is usually well stocked for a six-month supply to keep up with orders, although during busy sales periods, the company typically orders extra inventory.\nThe current ownership now works around 30 hours per week on the business, with an employee on board to handle packaging and shipping. A second employee could be brought on to monitor and process new orders, which would reduce the owner’s weekly workload significantly.\nThe company has strong relations with its suppliers, giving this brand the ability to maintain a reliable inventory of products their customers are looking for, and they have a clear edge over competitors because it eagerly fills smaller orders for customers that are hard to find through rival businesses that primarily focus on fulfilling large orders.\nDigital marketing represents one of this company’s strongest scale opportunities outside of launching new products.\nThe company has primarily relied on PPC ads on Facebook, Instagram, and Google to drive sales, and it has worked very effectively for them, recently increasing their Repeat Customer rate from 10% to 25%.\nThis marketing campaign has given the brand an average of 6,000+ unique monthly visitors, or about 2,000+ a month.\nThere are ways this company could boost its organic traffic and enjoy much higher revenue in the future. One would be to fully optimize their website through an SEO program that uses popular keywords to get them higher rankings in search engines. That could also include launching a blog on the website to attract new visitors.\nA social media marketing campaign and an email marketing campaign would both effectively drive sales higher as the company began launching new products, giving them the ability to highlight each new SKU to their existing customer base.\nThis is a small business with fantastic potential. The company has established a loyal customer base with just 17 SKUs and has built up strong brand recognition and a reputation for quality products within the trucking industry while demonstrating a great deal of insight by marketing products specifically designed to meet cargo safety rules.\nWith plenty of solid opportunities to scale this business, this is a leader in its niche space just waiting for the right investor.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents an Amazon FBA brand that is brewing up sales in the home goods and kitchen industry. They offer a line of fantastic products that include, but aren’t limited to, appliances like air fryers and coffee makers, and use a hybrid model to keep their inventory management going smoothly. For smaller products, they use FBA, while larger items are merchant-fulfilled. This model helps maximize profits and improves their shipment efficiency.\nThey have nearly 80 SKUs available for sale, which target many of the common needs and demands a consumer requires for their home and kitchen. They have an Average Order Value of $150 and ship out 10 to 12 orders every day. As customers require a reliable appliance regardless of the season, they see consistent demand throughout the year.\nThe brand sources their products from an extensive network of distributors and contacts that the current owner established by meeting them at various trade shows. This network lets them purchase SKUs depending on product availability and price. The current owner also regularly searches for the latest trends through JungleScout and other search options, which allows them to identify which products would sell best in certain categories and add them to their roster.\nMarketing\nThe very nature of the company serves as their own organic marketing, as they specializes in selling products from well-known household names like Nespresso or various Ninja Products. This means that, instead of having to invest in a carefully strategized marketing campaign, the company can sit back and let their SKUs advertise themselves. The success of this strategy speaks for itself, as while they have no active marketing tactics, paid or otherwise, to speak of, they still see about 48,560 visitors on average to their storefront every month. The buyer can change this strategy by investing in PPC on Amazon, but while it may lead to a higher viewership rate, it’s by no means required for the brand’s continued growth.\nManagement and Inventory\nThe company is currently maintained exclusively by the owner, who is responsible for handling customer service, the store’s inventory and pricing, and other general tasks needed for day-to-day operations. Given the fact that the owner is the sole employee of the business, the buyer could easily reduce their workload simply by hiring a few employees to help manage some of these tasks. This move would give the new owner more time and freedom to research new products, improve operations, and scale the business.\nTheir current hybrid model serves them well, with any larger product shipments handled through a warehouse with 20×30 feet in space. Depending on the buyers’ preferences, they could tweak the brand’s inventory model to lean more towards this stock model, or, alternatively, push things more in the direction of FBA, which is currently responsible for their smaller product shipments.  However, by obtaining more warehouse space, the company could store more products, which could easily lead to them generating over 50 to 60k a month in gross sales by selling the items that they already have in stock.\nScale Opportunities\nThere are several noteworthy methods that an ambitious buyer could implement to scale the company and their profits. A reliable strategy would be to continue releasing new categories and brands each month, as the owner’s experience with regularly adding new products has given positive results. Expanding into new categories would also let the buyer capitalize on the demand that those other markets have, broadening the number of consumers that the company can appeal to and diversifying their sales. The buyer could facilitate this expansion by partnering with new suppliers, and by continuing the market research that the current owner often does.\nThe company also has an active Brazilian storefront, which has so far been operating in an invite-only capacity. The buyer could dedicate efforts towards improving this store, which would increase its profitability and serve as an excellent stepping stone towards further international expansion. They could establish a presence across Amazon’s global storefronts to achieve this broader reach, leading to a larger available customer base and, in turn, stronger profits for the buyer to look forward to as the company grows.\nConclusion\nThis deal offers a brand that’s as sweet as they are straightforward, and operates out of an industry that enjoys steady demand across different seasons and demographics. Because their products feature such recognizable household brands, customers naturally seek them out, cutting out the work required in creating and maintaining an effective marketing campaign. The buyer also needs no real special skills to manage the business, though they would benefit from knowing how to read sales charts and pick up on the latest market trends. With some polishing dependent on the new owner’s needs, continued market research, and new additions to the product roster, the company could quickly skyrocket and offer their buyer a great ROI.",

Today, these sought-after products are shipped to customers worldwide, and the potential for scale and reaching broader audiences is immense, with the business’s day-to-day operations requiring no alterations for such growth. The system in place is efficient, effective, and inherently scalable, laying a solid foundation for sustained growth.\nAs noted above, one of the features of this business that makes it unique is its marketing prowess and tailored sales funnels, skillfully guiding customers toward making purchases, thereby driving a greater AOV. These sales funnels have undergone extensive split-testing with substantial traffic volumes, ensuring they outperform competitors and secure a leading edge in the market. The marketing system and process created by the current owner can easily be expanded into virtually any category of products, all of which can provide remarkable returns on ad spend.\nThe company’s adaptability and resilience are deeply rooted in its innovative DropShipping model. This strategy has mitigated the risks associated with maintaining substantial inventory or managing warehouses or warehouse personnel. The company maintains a nimble position by holding little stock and swiftly adjusting product offerings to cater to ever-changing customer demands and emerging market trends. This agile approach has it to stay ahead of the competition and cater to consumer needs more effectively, establishing a solid reputation. Continuously testing new products, marketing angles, and strategies further strengthens the business’s position, cementing its status as an industry leader that thrives amidst dynamic market conditions.\nFor a buyer of this business, this is a golden acquisition opportunity, particularly for those who already own a brand or envision using it as a solid platform for future mergers and acquisitions. The potential to seamlessly integrate other SKUs into the existing system would create additional sales, bolstering the already impressive cash flow generated by the company. The strategic sourcing of products directly from factories ensures the highest quality and optimal fulfillment.\nOperating under a hybrid inventory model, the company maintains a small level of stock to expedite the fulfillment of high-volume products. With an impressive dispatch rate of up to 1,500 orders daily, customers enjoy swift delivery facilitated by express shipping methods, further enhancing the overall shopping experience.\nDigital marketing efforts primarily encompass Facebook and Instagram ads, complemented by well-crafted email marketing campaigns. This multi-channel approach strategically targets the company’s typical customer base, comprising individuals aged 40 to 50, with an equal gender distribution. Most of these US-based customers exhibit a strong affinity for online shopping. Their receptiveness to direct response offers and active social media presence present valuable opportunities for customer conversion and engagement.\nThanks to the emphasis on evergreen products, sales remain steady throughout the year, providing a stable revenue stream. The company does experience a healthy peak in the fourth quarter, with the exception of a popular heater product that is exclusively promoted during the winter months to capitalize on seasonal demand.\nThe owner’s involvement in the business is minimal, dedicating just five to ten hours weekly to focus on important tasks such as managing advertising budgets and communicating with suppliers. The presence of competent staff further supports seamless operations.\nWith a well-optimized and largely automated business model, no specialized skills are required to manage the company successfully. However, expanding the team to explore multiple advertising channels would help unlock its full potential.\nIn a forward-thinking approach, the founder has acknowledged several scale opportunities, all of which hold significant promise for top and bottom-line growth. One such avenue involves expanding into different regions and translating the proven formula of sales funnels into multiple languages, catering to diverse markets. Furthermore, diversifying advertising platforms beyond Facebook and Instagram presents substantial potential to amplify revenue significantly. Implementing retargeting campaigns and forging strategic partnerships with influencers can yield fruitful results, enhancing customer engagement and loyalty. Additionally, introducing a subscription service offers a viable strategy to reduce customer acquisition costs and increase lifetime value. By expanding the staff, the business can scale more swiftly, paving the way for future growth and market dominance. Creating branded sub-stores around each product while focusing on brand awareness will further solidify the company’s position as a reputable market leader.\nThe groundwork has been laid for this streamlined eCommerce business to achieve dynamic expansion, presenting an enticing lifestyle acquisition for buyers seeking healthy profits with minimal workload demands. With a strategic focus on customer satisfaction, versatile marketing techniques, and innovative fulfillment strategies, the business stands at the forefront of the eCommerce landscape, poised for even greater success in the years ahead.",

The company does use contractors for some design work and to oversee social media accounts and the content for the newsletter.\nWith so many regular subscribers and repeat customers, the company always maintains up to 6 months’ worth of inventory to keep up with demand.\nMarketing\nDigital marketing represents a huge scale opportunity for this company, which has relied on PPC ads on Amazon to help drive sales.\nIn addition, with an email database containing 6,800+ subscribers, their newsletter has become an effective way to keep customers aware of the benefits of their products and to promote upsells.\nThe company also has a popular social media account on Facebook with 3,200+ followers, and the organic traffic from those posts helps drive 3,800+ unique monthly visitors to their website.\nThat gives the company plenty of opportunity to keep growing with additional digital marketing tools, which could include video marketing on TikTok and YouTube, an influencer marketing campaign on their social media accounts, and an SEO program on their Shopify site.\nTo millions of people, Supplements are like morning coffee – something they use daily. When those supplements give them results, they become loyal and faithful customers. This brand has demonstrated they know exactly how to provide the supplements people are eagerly looking for and transform those first-time buyers into ones who enthusiastically subscribe to their products.\nThis is a business that requires no special skills on the part of a buyer and is so highly automated that it runs itself. With high recurring revenues and a nearly decade-long track record, this is a phenomenal opportunity for a buyer to get into a highly lucrative field.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents an eCommerce leader in the Gardening and Outdoor Recreation verticals, whose products have become particularly popular with customers who enjoy the camping lifestyle. This is a huge industry and one where the customer base definitely appreciates the effort to provide them with specialized equipment and gear that they need.\nThe company operates successfully as an Amazon-based business, using Fulfillment By Amazon for rapid deliveries and strong customer service. With that eCommerce giant handling most of the tasks, the current ownership has only minimal involvement in running daily operations. All their listings are fully optimized, so the chief task for a new owner would be reordering products which are then sent to Amazon, where the company has become a premiere garden and camping brand.\nWith 54 SKUs at an Average Order Value of $48, their trademarked and branded products are popular with customers and have given the company a steady stream of passive income, particularly in the summer and around the holidays.\nWith two design patents in hand, the brand has continued to grow without adding new products, although that’s one of many strong scale opportunities for this company.\nA strong reason for those growth opportunities is the strength of the verticals this company is operating in. Both the global gardening equipment and camping products markets have enjoyed skyrocketing growth in recent years, with the gardening market valued at $84 billion and the camping equipment market at $46 million. Both markets attract similar customers, including people who love the outdoors and nature, environmentalists, horticulturalists, and Do It Yourself (DIY) enthusiasts. Whether they are working in their own garden at home or out on the road, they are committing a lot of their disposable income to these products.\nWithin these vibrant fields, the company has an interesting success story to tell that should appeal to a prospective buyer looking for an eCommerce business operating on the solid financial ground and with terrific growth options.\nLaunched in 2016, the company has continued to grow as its customer base has continued expanding, boosted by their decision to operate on a very popular platform with Amazon, one that has been successful enough to also start selling products on Amazon’s UK platform.\nWith 25 SKUs sold in the US and 15 in the UK, the company attracts sales from both men and women, and in every age group from 25 to 64. The largest percentage of their sales come from buyers in the 45-54 age group. The company also has an Amazon Climate Friendly Pledge badge on several of their products, which has become an excellent marketing tool for them.\nWhile their products attract buyers year-round, sales peak during the summer months, which is the height of the camping and hiking season. The holidays represent another peak time for their profits. Since the camping markets in both the US and UK continue to see year-over-year growth, the company is well positioned to increase profits in future years.\nOnce their products are sourced from the manufacturer, they are shipped directly from the manufacturer to Amazon, which handles shipments through FBA.\nWith FBA handling shopping and customer service, the current ownership now spends about 10 hours per week running the business, focusing on tasks that include ordering materials and inventory from suppliers and monitoring advertising campaigns.\nThe company employs a manager who oversees daily operations, while all customer support issues are handled by Amazon, while a PPC agency oversees their ad campaign on the platform.Because of the high demand for their products, the company always maintains four months’ stock. They do not use a warehouse since Amazon FBA stocks their products for them.\nTargeted PPC ad spends on Amazon have been their main marketing tool from the beginning. Operating on Amazon’s Seller Central, the platform has enabled the company to quickly find their target audience, and they continue to attract highly enthusiastic 5 Star reviews from their customers.\nThe company has additional growth opportunities through digital marketing. With 1,500+ subscribers in their email database, the company could use an aggressive email marketing campaign and newsletter as a tool for promotions, discounts, launching new products, and attracting more upsells and cross-sells.\nThe company could also invest in a social media marketing campaign on sites such as Facebook and Instagram, a video marketing campaign on YouTube and TikTok, and an influencer campaign to further build their brand recognition.\nThe company could also add new products, which is something the brand hasn’t done in a while, and sell them on new sales channels such as Walmart, eBay and a new Shopify website of their own.\nThey could also expand the size and color of some of their most popular products, while bundling many of them to attract more repeat customers.\nThe American passion for camping and gardening is likely to be around for a while long time, and there’s no question this successful business could do the same. An ambitious owner could tap into the multiple opportunities to grow this business and become an exceptional leader in these two thriving niche verticals.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents an SBA Pre-Qualified eCommerce Brand with a unique assortment of No-Show Socks, one of the hottest apparel trends within the apparel category. At inception, the company recognized the gap in the market and the limited options for people eagerly looking for no-show socks that fit properly and stay that way over time. It quickly became clear they would have to create a highly effective designs for their socks. Their growing sales and 33% Net Profit Margins make it clear that there is a very high demand for what they’re offering.\nThe company generates highly enthusiastic customer reviews and receives frequent calls for their product line to be expanded with new colors – with over 10,000 rave reviews and counting, their customers clearly appreciate the men’s and women’s socks that the company markets on its Shopify Website. With an Average Order Value of $32, the company has expanded to 40 SKUs offering a range of different sizes and colors, and their customers appreciate it: they now have a hefty 57.33% Repeat Customer Rate.\nTheir sales channel got a significant boost when the company entered into a relationship with the TV program Good Morning America to sell their socks on occasional GMA Deals & Seals segments, which are typically done up to 5 times a year. This has become a proven sales method for the brand, which could easily be scaled by targeting additional TV deals on other network programming.\nLaunched in 2016, the company created its own design for their no-show socks and has an exclusivity agreement with their supplier. Their initial design went through a rigorous prototyping process based on samples and testing over a period of several years, and their products turned out to be something customers definitely wanted. As their reputation and brand recognition improved, growth happened quickly. Today, their sales are not impacted by seasonality factors and stay steady throughout the year, although they do enjoy peaks during the spring and summer months and around the holidays.\nThe company hasn’t changed its design in years, but they have grown their SKUs. While their Men’s & Women’s no-show socks are classified as two products on Shopify, they now have plenty of variations to offer in different sizes and colors. They sell to customers in every age group, with high conversions among both women and men over age 35. In 2022, the company sold nearly 100,000+ Women’s No-Show Socks and nearly 41,000+ Men’s No-Show Socks. So far in 2023 return customer rate has risen to 57.33%.

In 2022 it was 41.8%.\nTheir Deals & Steals arrangement was launched in 2018 when GMA first reached out to the company, and they have since become a top converter on that platform, typically a one-minute shoutout. GMA also promotes their products through emails and across the ABC network, and in return, the company pays ABC a 25% fee. Those sales bring the company up to $290,000+ per episode.\nThe company is unique in that while other companies offer no-show socks, this brand remains one of the few that focuses exclusively on them, and few competitors have been able to match the high quality they put into their products, which are popular for remaining firmly on the soles of the customer, as intended.\nThis is a highly efficient operation, which requires as little as 3 hours or less per week for the current ownership to operate, and without any employees. Their inventory is stocked at a 3PL and the company now ships up to 200+ products each day. Their reach continues to expand outside the U.S., with an increasing number of sales across Europe and Australia.\nThe global market for no-show socks is booming today, as an expanding number of customers of all ages look for comfortable, breathable socks that are designed to stay on and stay hidden. This brand has effectively demonstrated how to satisfy those customers and give them exactly what they’re looking for, and now, with nearly a decade of experience building up their customer base, this business is perfectly positioned for a major growth curve.\nThe company stocks between $200,000 and $500,000 worth of inventory, depending on the sales season, and the 3PL manages all daily shipping and receiving for the company, as well as customer service by email. This has enabled the current ownership to work as little as two hours a week on this highly automated business, with a focus on handling marketing, ordering new inventory, and occasionally outsourcing some select tasks.\nThe business usually invests in new inventory every 3-4 months and stocks up on larger orders to get a lower price by ordering in bulk.\nWith their $32 AOV, this marks another scale opportunity for a buyer, since the company hasn’t raised its prices since 2019. With high repeat order products from a loyal customer base, there is ample room to revisit their pricing in the future.\nWhile their GMA episodes have demonstrated the company has the perfect product for TV deals, the company has also invested in other digital marketing tools to drive sales higher, including PPC ads on Google and promoting their products on Facebook and Instagram, where they have a combined 40,000+ followers. The company has also invested in a growing affiliate marketing campaign to help expand their customer base.\nTheir social media marketing is boosting their organic traffic and is now bringing 30,000+ unique monthly visitors to their Shopify site.\nThe company has additional marketing tools to tap into. Their email database has a hefty 250,000+ subscribers and an email newsletter would likely boost their Repeat Customer Rate even higher. Their affiliate marketing campaign also points to the likely success of launching an influencer campaign on their social media platform.\nCompanies succeed and thrive when they know how to solve problems that customers have, and this company did just that by providing them with comfortable and stylish no-show socks that don’t slip off. With a huge number of 5 Star reviews and customer testimonials to promote on their website, the company has demonstrated they fully understood what their buyers wanted and how to market to them.\nWith that strong foundation, the company has major opportunities for expansion in the hands of an ambitious buyer, and this fully automated business is one that requires no special skills from a new owner, or a heavy workload. On the other hand, the brand’s recurring revenues and strong name recognition are an outstanding foundation for future growth.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a 13-year-old Outerwear Brand that offers cruelty-free, sustainable outerwear & apparel for women, men, kids & dogs. Stylish, high-quality faux fur, vegan leather, parkas & puffers and much more are offered by this company, which has seen sustained growth over the years.\nThe business started out initially offering its in-house brand of products via Wholesale, which it still does today, but it has expanded to eCommerce and drop shipping for 3rd party retailers as well. All of this has resulted in continued growth for this well-run machine.\nRather than use animal byproducts for their apparel, the company has a cruelty-free promise with all its customers; it exclusively sources cutting-edge textiles and sustainable, non-animal-based goods. This reassures customers that the company is serious about what their brand promises to do and has caused their products to become very popular within the eco-friendly niche. The enthusiasm of their audience can be seen through their number of social media followers, with the company having just over 32,000 followers on Facebook and nearly 100,000 on Instagram.\nThe business was founded by a group of animal lovers, where they are well aware of just how important preserving the natural world around us really is to consumers around the globe.\nThe company offers a wide and diverse range of outerwear products, consisting of knitted and woven outwear, shirts, bottoms, hats, gloves, scarves, bags, and even shoes. As their products are fantastic for keeping warm during the cold season, their sales peak throughout the last six months of the year.\nTo counteract this seasonality throughout the rest of the year, the buyer could introduce new apparel to better fit the warmer months, pursue global expansion, or focus on advertising certain products through their social media platform. The company has already put in the effort to trademark their brand name and products, which has improved their presence on social media and their profits, as a result.\nOwnership sources most of their products’ raw materials from a network of valuable suppliers, with 20% of their products accounting for 80% of total sales. They strive to identify and source only the finest quality materials, which lets them release new, essential long-term products while still sticking to their nature-loving mission.\nThe company invests in 2 large inventory orders every year, with stock totaling around $4 million during peak season and half of that throughout the slower quarters. They are actively in the process of liquidating inventory in product categories they have decided to scrap.\nTheir main sales channels are wholesale and D2C, which means that substantial growth can be seen by focusing on these two areas. They fill in an average of 200 wholesale orders daily, and over 100 wholesale accounts are starting to bring in a noteworthy profit. Most of their orders are fulfilled through their own warehouse.\nOne of the company’s main goals going into the future is increasing their eCommerce sales in the US, especially through the Amazon platform. Their share of US sales grew to 56.7 percent in 2021, doubling their domestic sales across the last five years. Amazon has swiftly become America’s digital market leader in online retail sales, with clothing and accessories being treated with the importance they deserve. Additionally, research has shown that more than six in every ten customers begin their search for a new product through Amazon.\nThe overwhelming popularity of the company means that global expansion would be a very promising venture. The right buyer could use Amazon for domestic and international sales, skyrocketing their profits. They could also, alternatively, choose to outsource this task to a qualified agency, giving them a great ROI and saving the buyer valuable time.\nThe fashion industry as a whole is highly promising, with clothing, accessories, and shoes being expected to hit $1,74 trillion globally this year. The digital era has allowed it to surge in size like never before, and it has already grown into the world’s largest eCommerce sector. The online market is predicted to reach $1 trillion over the next five years and register a compound annual growth rate of 8.6% between 2022 and 2030. The women’s sector has also been playing a large part in how vast the industry has grown, as given that it makes up 70% of all revenue in the industry, the rise of the working women population has been highly beneficial. By establishing themselves through wholesale and D2C, this company has been able to easily ride the trend to their current success.\nThe current owner plays a somewhat passive role within the company, with their responsibilities largely consisting of meetings with the MD and important department heads. Daily operations are handled by the business’ highly capable staff team, and SEO, PPC, and content are outsourced to contractors.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents an eCommerce provider of High-End Luxury and Designer Home Furnishings, with more than two decades of experience building up trusted relationships with some of the top brand leaders in this industry. This has given the company exclusive supplier deals to provide a vast product portfolio of home furniture and décor products for both direct-to-consumer sales and a fast growing percentage of B2B orders as well.\nTheir customer base is increasingly diverse and includes a large percentage of people who own multiple properties and have become repeat buyers for furnishing each home.

The company is active on Instagram, where they maintain a massive 32,000+ followers, Pinterest (27,400+ followers) and on Facebook (22,000+ followers).  They also work with select influencers to exchange products for promotions and advertising.\nThey have an SEO program on their Shopify website to boost their search engine rankings and run PPC ads on Google to drive sales higher. Their content marketing works exceptionally well to expand the number of visitors coming to their website.

While 52% of their Repeat Orders are from their B2B clients, they now enjoy a 20% Repeat Order Rate on their DTC sales as well.\nExpanding their digital marketing campaigns even further is one of many great scale opportunities available for this company. Having enjoyed success through their influencer campaigns, the company could launch an affiliates campaign with luxury designers, agents and others in this industry to boost their brand recognition even higher.\nThey could also expand into a video marketing campaign on sites such as TikTok and YouTube, with videos demonstrating how attractive their furniture looks in new homes.\nThe company could also expand sales on top eCommerce sites such as Amazon and Walmart as another key growth strategy.\nAn Experienced Team in Place\nDaily operations are efficiently handled by the company’s experienced and professional team of 12 employees, including a communications operator, visual merchandiser, general manager, merchandising specialist, two website sales specialists, two full-time salespeople, and others in charge of billing, Human Resources, and SEO and data control.\nThe current ownership is eager to share information with the buyer about how to effectively sell higher end furnishings and to maintain vital relationships with prominent vendors.\nThis sale could also include a brick-and-mortar store that the company has maintained to keep the line of communication open with their suppliers.

Through ups and downs in the economy over the last 2 decades, this business has continued to hum along, showing its resiliency and ability to withstand even the harshest of times. It has very little concentration risk in products or sales channels, and has a loyal customer base of corporations, governments and organizations. This is not your average eCommerce business.\nWith a well-earned reputation for quality products, fast and reliable customer service and quick shipping, the brand now markets to 250,000+ clients and enjoys a rising35% Repeat Customer Rate.\nTheir durability has given them far more assets than the immense catalog they have amassed.

Those SKUs come from a hefty 60,000+ product categories, giving the company an unmatched ability to provide business clients, agencies and organizations with virtually any item vital to their operations.\nTheir success is a prime example of how eCommerce has become so important to a host of industries and agencies that need a comprehensive array of industrial and technology products, laboratory equipment, and related supplies.

The company also attracts plenty of business from resellers; in fact many of the company’s suppliers regularly buy from the company products they themselves don’t carry.\nSales on their online marketplaces, including Amazon and Newegg, recently started to exceed purchases made on their own website. In 2021, 65% of their sales came from their website, but in 2022, 53% were being made on their marketplaces. This mix varies by month and year.

With a scalable infrastructure that gives them a foundation for continued growth, profits could skyrocket by expanding their supplier base to increase the range of products being offered, expanding sales to their existing enterprise customers, and increasing their SKU count on Amazon. Everything is firmly in place for tremendous future growth.\nThis represents an exceptional opportunity for a shrewd investor. Any buyer looking for a profitable, scalable, and firmly established B2B company can look no further than this business’ impressive and lengthy track record of success. The new owner will get an extremely valuable customer list that includes enterprise accounts generating repeat orders, and work being performed by a loyal and dedicated team. Their growth trajectory in the current marketplace is guaranteed. For a new owner, the only question is how quickly they want to scale operations, because the infrastructure and customer base is there to rapidly accomplish it.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a 22 Year Veteran that provides a wide variety of Software Solutions and Managed Services. This technology company has a loyal customer base of devoted clients, their own in-house programming shop, and a long track record of high performance, high quality work within the critical Banking and Financial Services Sectors, where they have gravitated to as their primary customer base.\nServices offered by this veteran of the industry include cyber security solutions, cloud computing support services, web and mobile app development, website support help desk, search engine marketing (organic and paid), general data protection (GDPR), cyber security and GDPR certification, and 24/7 IT support.\nWhat’s not to love? With more than two decades of experience providing professional management to clients in the financial sector, the company’s focus on cyber security, software development, certification and mobile app projects has given them nearly 750 satisfied clients on 1,820 completedprojects and a 75% Customer Retention Rate from a large number of satisfied clients – many of whom stay with the company for 10+ years.\nAnd for a new owner – this customer retention and recurring revenue is a risk mitigation factor for any acquisition. The customer base represents the building blocks upon which a new owner can continue to scale the business for many years to come. Starting up a new company to provide these serviceswould take years, with an unknown outcome … but with the acquisition of this company’s assets, you get a highly regarded staff with a great deal of industry experience, a focus in a particular sector that cements your foothold within in, the aforementioned recurring revenue, and the ability to scale into other verticals, service offerings and industries, either through organic development or through continued M&A.\nThe company is known in the industry for a number of things, including its smart, competitive prices, the high-quality software they create, and their design agency. The company handles all aspects of modern online solutions for its clients, including cyber security consultancy, maintenance, training, backups, email and cloud support to keep businesses running efficiently. They have no need to  outsource any of their services. With 50% of their revenue now recurring and contract based, the company is enjoying on average 30+% margins on the work they perform.\nTheir work is being done in a high-growth industry, with the global cybersecurity market alone valued at $202.72 billion in 2022 and expected to enjoy a 12.3% growth through 2030. Three key factors are driving this growth.\nOne is the rapid proliferation of eCommerce sites today, which gives consumers more choices but also tends to attract more cybercriminals looking for new and sophisticated ways to hack into company data. That’s left businesses and organizations aggressively looking for the most advancedcybersecurity solutions possible.\nThe second impacting trend has been the rapid growth since the pandemic of employees working from home, often on multiple devices on anonymous networks, putting new pressure on data security. The third has been government regulations that impose mandatory cybersecurity regulations onbusinesses within the financial services sector.\nThese trends all work in favor of this industry maintaining skyrocketing rates of high growth and increased profitability, including this business. Let’s take a closer look at their history to illustrate their strengths and achievements.\nLaunched 22 years ago, much of their work has been directed to the banking and financial services sector, which in the UK is heavily regulated. This regulation results in a need to constantly update systems, particularly as it relates to cyber security. Today, customized software development forLondon-based banks represents 63% of their sales but not a single client represents more than 7.3% of their revenue. This diversification reduces the risks and increases the positive predictable results within the business.\nIn addition to banking, the company has experienced growth from clients in logistics, the wholesale industry, and legal firms, and they are now directing their marketing to construction firms. Their success has rested on attracting the owners of thriving businesses that are aware of how significantly the digitalization of their operations enables them to grow. These companies are looking for a reliable technology partner who can provide them with long-term solutions.\nWorking with regular clients ensures very high money collection rates – 97% in 30 days, 99% in 60 days. Credit management and accounts receivable aging has never been a problem for this business.\nWith the average length of their contracts extending for 10+ years, referrals and testimonials from satisfied clients continue to expand their customer base. The company usually asks for referrals during client services meetings and their customers are all too happy to oblige. Today most of the work they receive comes from existing clients.\nThe company has also been successful at attending Trade Shows and exhibitors, which has generated more leads, and they organize webinars and lectures in their office to educate prospective clients on their services.\nThey also apply digital marketing techniques to their own scale operations. They have an active social media presence on sites that include Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Instagram, using each one to build brand awareness of who they are, what they do, and what they have accomplishedfor clients.\nThere are 25 landing pages on their website which are fully optimized for search engines, and they continue to optimize the website on a regular basis. They also maintain an informational blog on their website to expand their customer base.\nWith 8,500 email subscribers, they regularly update business clients on their digital solutions. The campaigns consist of two informational posts followed by a sales offer with a clear call to action (CTA). Then repeat within a month.\nThese marketing tools have come in handy as the company continues to expand its reach into new industries. Those tools are also enabling the company to get an average of 3-5 sales leads each week. Information Security is a significant topic today, and the company often gets invited to be the keynote speaker at seminars, lectures, and Joint Ventures events. This builds awareness of their services and converts to more business with low costs and high profits.\nThis agency has an experienced team based in Bulgaria that handles all tasks related to their work assignments so none of it needs to be sourced outside of the company. Their experience and professionalism have enabled the company to take full advantage of the trend toward stronger software development regulations across the European Union, which has also pushed their prices higher with new and existing clients, and their team is fluent in English and works well with the London office. Located in close proximity to the local Technical University the company can flexibly increase or decrease their staff and select the best talent in town while keeping the cost significantly low. This constant flow of highly-talented post-graduates very often are being paid by funding from the European Union just to help them to get on the career lather ASAP.\nAs long as online security remains a major concern, agencies such as this one will reap the benefits of businesses, governments, private organizations and a wide swath of industries that need the best, most effective digital solutions to protect their data and client accounts. This brand’s two decades oldreputation for excellence in this field provides a buyer with a loyal customer base, strong recurring revenues, and terrific scale prospects.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents an eCommerce Book Publisher and Content Creator that has a strong team of freelancers in place that create content in the form of fiction books. So far, the company has built a strong portfolio of assets in the form of 167 books in various formats. Their intellectual property has been registered in numerous countries.\n­Having sold 15 million+ copies of their books so far, generating profits of $35 million+ over the past decade, the company has demonstrated that there is demand for original fiction novels that appeal to key segments of the book-buying consumer.\nUsing the talents of skilled freelancer writers, the books are marketed under a pen name that has become synonymous with popular Young Adult fiction, an enormously lucrative market that this company has won over, while also appealing to adult readers.\nTheir fiction novels appeal to lovers of fantasy, romance, action, and mystery, and are readily available online in paperback, audiobooks and as eBooks. Published in eight different languages, the company has demonstrated how profitable independent book publishing can be if the writing captures the imagination of readers and their marketing attracts a fast-growing and loyal following.\nThe book publishing industry has radically changed thanks to eCommerce. No longer is book publishing limited to a handful of large publishing houses. Today original works are made available online, and through creative digital marketing (particularly social media), traditional publishing houses and rapidly disappearing brick-and-mortar bookstores are being bypassed.\nToday the global book publishing market is valued at $93 billion and projected to reach $136.1 billion by 2030 as online retail bookstores match soaring consumer interest in eBooks and digital audiobooks. As long as the quality of the books is high, readers today are all too eager to explore what eCommerce bookshops have to offer.\nA buyer can consider this company’s profits, which average $4.9 million per year in the past 8 years of operation, where all revenue is generated through royalties, while at the same time, the company is not dependent on a single author and has low expenses for each book creation – all highly attractive propositions for whoever acquires this thriving business. The company has 4 new books ready to be launched, and they have clearly demonstrated that their audience is eager for more.  Additionally, they have signed agreements with two large international literary agencies that could have a huge impact on the company’s future.\nTheir Products\nThe company hires freelance writers, each of whom has different job skills for every stage of a book’s development. For inspiration, the company has relied on readers who suggest ideas for new books and review manuscripts and make recommendations for possible changes. This has not only enabled the company to keep in sync with their readers but has been highly cost-effective.\nThe company’s revenue comes from the royalties they generate from the sale of their books by third party publishers. Their book series are sold on Amazon, and the brand has proven to be a top seller in several genres, including Vampire Romance, the Paranormal, and Fantasy.\nMost impressively, the company has expanded sales beyond its target audience of Young Adults and is watching sales rapidly increase among women ages 40-60.\nTheir Marketing\nFrom the start, the success of each book has been directly proportional to how much is spent on marketing, and their marketing activities have focused on running PPC ads on Amazon and Facebook.  This has enabled the company to get their books picked up for additional distribution through retailers such as BookBub and GoodReads. Visitors to their website are directed to sales on Amazon.\nOrganic traffic is also driven through the company’s social media accounts, particularly Facebook, where they have 15,000+ followers and make announcements about new, upcoming books to stay engaged with their most loyal readers.\nThe company has some significant scale opportunities available, particularly by directing their advertising to the Asian market, specifically China and India. The company has already received interest from TenCent, a Chinese multinational firm, and those contracts will be made available to the company’s new owner.\nThe company has four books that are ready to be published, including two that would mark the first in a new series. Other assets include recently signed agreements with two international literary agencies.  Those are assets that would also get transferred to the new owner.\nOperations\nThis business is highly automated, and the current ownership spends just 10 hours per week running it. Those activities include establishing budgets for marketing and content creation and defining the general guidelines of the company. The current owner is excited to help a new owner with the transition, teaching everything that is needed to successfully move forward in this company, but more so, is happy to also help for the longer term if needed for ongoing assistance with developing new series, adjacent verticals or anything else that might be necessary. The owner has told our firm that this succession plan has been many years in the making and it is going to be well organized to put the new owner into a position to be successful right out of the gates.\nThe staff for this brand is large and strong, with over 200 freelancer writers and contractors that direct marketing, edit books and serve in various capacities, including financial controller and others. This is a well-rounded staff of seasoned professionals that is ready to be guided to the next generation of this publishing house … and continue to make history.\nBooks remain a highly competitive field, as more than a few flash in the pan authors have discovered. Audience tastes change quickly, and it’s crucial to keep up with them. That’s one of the key benefits to owning this company: the fact that it has a faithful readership firmly in place, employs skillful writers, and is well established on strong eCommerce platforms. For a buyer, there are opportunities to take each book series in a different creative direction. But the operations of this company are firmly established, profitable, and ready to be scaled.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a Subscription Box Brand that delivers fun new Electronic Gadgets every quarter. All kind of random gadgets are found in these boxes, from personal coffee cup warmers to drones, projectors and everything in between … there is certain to be something for everybody in one of these quarterly surprise boxes. Finding a specific gift for that certain someone is always hard, but a gift that keeps on giving all year long is one that makes you more memorable as the gift giver.\nWith an Average Customer LTV of $570, the brand has proven its ability to develop an audience of rave customers that love the products provided in each new box they (or their gifted recipients) receive.\nToday, roughly 90% of their profits are from recurring revenue. The company has diversified to include the sale of individual products contained within the boxes and has found that their products are exceptionally popular as gifts. Sales perform well during the holidays.\nThe foundation of the company is such that the company is well-positioned to scale beyond their DTC Website, which is currently their only sales channel. Outside of their regular subscription box customers, they now also sell individual products that have been showcased in their boxes. They have also begun the process of reaching out to companies to offer their subscription boxes as gifts for their employees and clients.\nThe company equally benefits from long-standing partnerships with top-name brands eager to have their items included in this company’s boxes. Highly enthusiastic reviews from satisfied customers have become great word-of-mouth advertising to family, friends and coworkers. This shows that over the 6+ years of operations, the company has proven to deliver on its promise to customers.\nSubscription boxes, or the recurring delivery of boxes filled with niche products, have soared in popularity in recent years. The key selling point of subscription boxes is that they introduce customers to brands and products they might not have known about otherwise. This enables the company to experiment with brands and products, giving them the freedom to get creative with what they offer their customers. The subscription industry generated $275 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow to $900 billion by 2026.\nThe number of people searching for subscription boxes has increased every year since 2018. In the past few years, more than 3,000 subscription boxes have been launched in the American market, many of them enjoying huge success and profitability. This company has proven to have staying power through operational efficiency and product creativity.\nLaunched in 2016, the company was able to attract its customer base after curating a unique set of gadgets, tech and other fun products. Their subscription boxes are filled with third-party products, although the company has also tested branding their own products as supplementary items. As sales have grown, the company has diversified its offerings to customers. More can be done on the private label side as this company grows.\nTheir boxes are available on both a seasonal and annual subscription plan, both recurring. They also created a category of Mystery Boxes which are a compilation of older products, which have the added benefit of offloading excess inventory. Their Lifestyle Shop offers individual products to purchase, and as noted above, is a great opportunity for the business to move beyond the website into marketplaces like Amazon.com.\nThese subscriptions are performing well, and most subscribers stay on for up to 2 years. Because of that, their Lifetime Customer Value is considerably higher at $570. Their products appeal to an attractive demographics of individuals from age 30 to 65, with 65% being women and 35% of the sales coming from men.\nWhile sales tend to soar during holidays and events, their subscription boxes and individual items have become popular as gifts no matter the time of year. The fourth quarter of the year can account for up to 30% of the company’s annual revenue, and the company’s B2B sales are getting stronger as they have successfully marketed their products as the ideal corporate gift-giving item. This will become a more significant part of how they generate revenue and will more fully diversify sales throughout the year as time progresses.\nFor their DTC sales, the company appeals to households earning $200,000+ a year. In an effort to diversify and attract customers with more modest incomes, the company is testing the launch of a “lite” box that would offer 2-4 products (rather than 4-8 in the original ones) and would be sold at a lower price. The company hopes this will help them attract a younger and less affluent demographic.\nThe company employs a diverse approach to attracting customers. With 20,000+ Instagram followers, this has boosted their organic traffic, giving the company 32,000+ unique monthly visitors to their site. They also have a blog on their website to attract followers, and use video marketing on YouTube, where they have enjoyed 72,000+ views.\nThe company runs PPC ads on Google and Facebook and uses affiliate marketing as a growth tool. Each method has been successful in getting the company to continue growing its subscriptions.\nTheir boxes have been recommended by Buzzfeed and have won accolades and awards like Reader’s Choice 2021 from My Subscription Addiction.\nThis is an exceptionally well-run business, with contractors in place to handle most of the daily operations. The company has also instituted Standard Operating Procedures that enable new contractors to quickly get up to speed.\nThe company continues to attract strong customer reviews and features on prominent websites that bring more organic traffic and sales. This is a brand with a lot of value, and they are growing just as the subscription industry is doing the same.",

        "title": "Amazon FBA eCommerce Brand – LED Lights for the Growing Pet Bird Industry – Mimics Bird Ecosystems – B2C & DTC Sales – $77 AOV",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents the leading LED natural light for bird enthusiasts, avian rescue rehab facilities, and universities across North America. The products, designed by the founder, are a first in eCommerce and immediately found a receptive customer base. Ninety percent of sales are derived from Amazon, with a Shopify-built website accounting for the remainder. Little marketing is done for either channel.\nStarting in 2018, the brand has achieved significant sales increases each year. In 2020, sales nearly doubled, and did so again in 2021. The business is on track for another excellent year. Revenue doubled in the first quarter of 2023 as demand has continued to grow in North America, and the brand launched in Europe and the UK. The public appetite in Europe has been insatiable, and products sold out in short order after the initial launch. Sales channels in Europe and the UK have now been established, and the brand’s supply chain partner is ready and able to increase production. Gross margins are around 50%, and as volume increases, management expects to improve that number by an additional 4% this year.\nThe light, available in six iterations, represents 84% of revenue, while the timer accessory makes up the balance and is an excellent upsell item. Across the range, the brand enjoys a $77 Average Order Value with no concentration of sales on any given SKU or client.\nProducts are sourced from an Asian manufacturer with whom the owner has a long-standing and solid relationship. The manufacturer builds and packages the proprietary products exclusively for the brand to its design specifications. Orders are placed every three to six months when funds are available. The minimum order quantity is 3,000 units, and the terms are a 40% down payment and 60% before shipping. Due to the explosive growth in sales, the business frequently sells out. As a result, a buyer with capital to purchase sufficient inventory could easily double sales within a year.\nThe owner dispatches Shopify orders daily and sends bulk stock to Amazon FBA facilities twice monthly. These include US, Canadian, UK, and German fulfillment centers.\nDigital marketing efforts are purposefully minimized because of sales demand. An agency handles PPC campaigns for all Amazon storefronts with a modest budget. When the owner has run Google Ads, Amazon promotions, or social media campaigns, he has needed to stop them because of inventory shortages. For example, a six-week campaign on Facebook and Instagram doubled sales on the Shopify store.\nThe typical customer is a middle to upper-middle-class empty nester woman whose birds are her replacement children and who has the means to spare no expense on the well-being of her pets. The pandemic introduced an enormous number of millennials to the hobby, and the industry is still benefiting.\nSales are healthy throughout the year, peaking from November through January\nThe owner works 20 hours weekly, focusing primarily on customer support, fulfilling Shopify orders, and keeping North American inventory in stock.\nAs prosperous as this business is, scale opportunities are abundant. A capital injection to purchase inventory is the quickest method to immediately boost the top and bottom lines exponentially. From there, management can increase its PPC budget on Amazon, expand the business-to-business product line, and introduce complementary products. Reigniting social media campaigns is proven, and implementing an influencer marketing campaign is an enticing prospect.\nNo employees work for the business, but Amazon PPC, bookkeeping, and accounting are outsourced.\nA buyer would benefit from knowing simple electrical principles, bird biology and how it is affected by light, and pet bird ownership challenges.\nThe existing owner is available for up to three months to help transition operations and customer support. Once a buyer has integrated seamlessly, he is open to working as a paid consultant for product development and expansion.\nThe pet bird industry has seen steady growth over the years, owing to an increasing interest in exotic pets, rising disposable incomes, and the trend toward urbanization.\nThe global market is projected to grow substantially, driven by increasing pet ownership, awareness about the benefits of keeping birds as pets, and the availability of various species and breeds.\nFurthermore, there has been a shift toward sustainable and ethical practices, with an increasing focus on bird welfare and conservation. This trend is likely to continue, with more consumers seeking pets and products that prioritize the health and well-being of their birds.",

In the 7 years this company has been operating, they have achieved an80% Repeat Customer Rate, demonstrating this agency’s strengths and its enormous scale potential in front of a highly loyal customer base.\nThe company is poised to make a push to develop a larger client base nationwide, and since their services are provided through a highly automated, remote system, a buyer can operate it using the skills of their experienced computer experts and enjoy solid recurring revenues without the need to devote much time or manpower to keeping it running. This business could run on as little as five hours of owner input each week from anywhere in the world.\nThis company provides IT services for both households and businesses, and additional services that include web design, search engine optimization and search engine marketing, and hosting services for websites and email systems as a Microsoft partner. Projects can be as small as fixing a virus on a computer to streamlining their client’s digital marketing efforts. This company prides itself on high-quality preventative maintenance for its business and household clients providing minimal downtime. Most of this preventative maintenance is provided through automated services, meaning excellent user experience with minimal man-hours.\nThe agency operates in a rapid growth industry. Virtually everyone today relies on their computer, laptop or smartphone for access to work, shopping, entertainment, home security and instant communication. The need for expert IT support is growing faster than ever, especially since the pandemic changed the nature of the working world, with so many employees today working remotely. Companies and their workers alike need reliable connectivity to keep operations running smoothly.\nGlobal spending on IT services is soaring today and is projected to reach $4.6 trillion by the end of 2023, a 5.1% increase over 2022. The rapid pace of global digital transformation has given agencies such as this one a dramatically expanding customer base.\nThe company’s strong reputation in this field, their ability to attract top-quality technicians and their solid growth potential should make this a very attractive proposition for a buyer, while a review of the company’s history will make those strengths really shine.\nLaunched in early 2016, the company has become well known for its IT services and digital marketing tools, which have brought them household clients and B2B sales on a steady basis. The agency has a proactive computer support subscription that keeps computers secure from cybercrimes, running fast, and fully up to date. The company will executive preventative maintenance tasks and alert the owner to any problems that arise. This product is also able to identify potential hardware upgrades for easy upselling opportunities. People love fast machines.\nThey offer packaged products and subscription-based services that provide this agency with recurring revenues from their satisfied clients.\nWhile technical services represent 55% of the company’s revenue stream, the company has expanded in unique ways. They launched an e-Commerce focused website that can be monetized in several ways, and a platform that helps small businesses get a simple, secure and effective website, either as a commercial website or as an eCommerce shop, without having to pay a developer thousands of dollars to get it.\nWhile the company’s sales are not impacted by seasonal factors, their profits rise when they promote upgrades to their clients’ software and hardware systems.\nA key reason for the company’s growth has been the highly enthusiastic response from their clients, which has enabled them to introduce and then effectively market new services to those customers.\nAdditionally, the agency has grown outside Hawaii and has clients in other states, and is poised for additional nationwide expansion.\nThis SEO agency has its own thriving SEO program.\nWhile the company initially used a PPC ad campaign on Google to promote their services, they were able to shift to their highly cost-effective SEO program to drive organic traffic to their website and boost sales. Just as the company has provided SEO and SEM services to their clients, they’ve demonstrated how effectively they can use those same tools to bring new customers on board.\nIn addition to understanding how best to use keywords to boost their rankings in search engines, the agency also has an educational and informative blog on their website to attract more readers who can eventually become clients.\nThis also provides the company with some impressive scale opportunities by employing the same kind of digital marketing tools they now offer clients. The company could revive its PPC ad campaign while also launching the agency’s first social media marketing campaign. A related tactic would be creative videos that outline their services and use them for effective video marketing on sites such as YouTube, TikTok and Twitter.\nWith a large email database, the company could also launch a regular online newsletter to educate existing clients about the full range of services this company provides or to promote the launch of new services to their existing client base.\nThis company does not require a heavy time commitment.\nDepending on how busy the company is, the current owner rarely spends more than 20 hours per week operating this company, and usually far less. Contracted and offshore technicians are used to handle assignments and these workers are available to handle nearly all daily operations.\nThe company utilizes a team of low-cost offshore technical experts as needed. These professionals are experts in a wide range of IT, SEO, programming, and marketing projects and can be hours worked scaled up or down at will. The company also maintains an on-call contract workforce for on-site work as necessary.\nThis is an agency that provides service to individuals, families, and a wide range of businesses, including eCommerce companies. They also are known for providing professional technical training to clients, sharing their knowledge and expertise to help clients make the best choices about the new technologies that are available to them. This has resulted in a very faithful client base, which gets transferred to the new owner.",

The heart of the business is connecting with the customer’s vision for their most revered room of the house—the bedroom. The team’s understanding and appreciation of the products, combined with personal attention and conversations with every customer, sets this company apart from the competition.\nTwo primary suppliers are used, with whom the owners have excellent relationships. Some beds are and have been exclusive to the company for years. However, the owners note that in their vast experience in the niche, exclusivity is less significant to consumers than good communication and product knowledge. In addition, the company is known for its customized orders. It has produced them for hotels, lodges, hospitals, movie and television shows, and organizations, including Ronald McDonald House.\nThe business enjoys year-round interest and sales with no heavy concentration on any given style, and the entire range is popular. Typical customers are men and women between 30 and 70, in all areas of the US.\nThe two owners take sales calls, process orders, send email confirmations, purchase orders to the factories and pickup requests to shipping companies, answer inquiries, pay bills and maintain the website.\nThe business is traditional in its approach to customer service. All customer calls and emails are dealt with directly by the owners. In addition, they process and navigate all questions, purchases, and fulfillment issues personally. This is necessary as all sales are handled by telephone because the website has no shopping cart. Despite having no digital marketing strategy, the company’s highly visible presence on the internet drives considerable traffic to the site.\nArguably the biggest selling point of the business is its enormous potential in the home furnishings eCommerce market. The wide variety of products, large email database, and low working capital requirements suggest the company is well-positioned for expansion.\nThe scalability potential is unlimited. Giving customers an even more straightforward online shopping experience would undoubtedly boost sales. Following that, a strategic digital marketing strategy across all channels would drive significantly more traffic to the site, improving the top and bottom lines. Google Ads for example, would be an easy start. Hyper marketing based on geographical locations presents an additional growth opportunity.\nA buyer could quickly build a substantial media presence using platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Google. The home décor niche lends itself particularly well to social media. Quality content combined with paid advertising could quickly boost and create sustainable growth.\nGrowing the email database is straightforward. Developing segmented campaigns would lead to excellent conversion rates, increased repeat business, and the ability to communicate special offers and new products to existing or prospective customers.\nListing on various eCommerce platforms, like Amazon and Walmart, is low-hanging fruit and can quickly be implemented by a tech-savvy buyer or outsourced for a healthy and potentially colossal return on investment. More than 60% of Americans begin searching for a product on Amazon. The business could use this opportunity to drive domestic sales and prepare for simpler international expansion.\nFew special skills are required to quickly and successfully operate this business. A buyer will, however, need to become familiar with the true history of the product, including production materials and techniques. They would also need an understanding of the shipping industry and its workings within the furniture world. Growing the business to include more home-furnishing products would require basic color theory and interior design knowledge. Unless and until the company is entirely navigated through a shopping cart, gaining customer trust through a phone conversation would be extremely helpful.\nThis reputable business has an extensive history of stable sales and a solid customer base. Furthermore, the minimal workload makes it an attractive opportunity for potential buyers looking for a manageable business.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a unique eLearning Business geared towards educating gig economy entrepreneurs on how to start up, run and become successful in their very own Business. The great thing about these gigs is that, like being an Uber Driver, each entrepreneur can decide whether they just want to do this as a side gig, or as a full-time job. In either case, there is plenty of money to be made.\nAs for Ownership of this Business, the company is well run with all of the systems and processes in place to smoothly transition the business to new ownership who can then take the reins and continue the company’s great growth trajectory.\nThe Program\nThe company’s program is dedicated to teaching its students everything they need to know to develop their own business, leveraging one of the most popular platforms on the Internet: from generating leads, to defining the work product and deliverable, to hiring the right candidates to perform the work, to collecting payments. The core of the training is comprised of a library of 34 detailed videos that guide students through the entire process. There are sales scripts provided to ensure students are hand-held through the entire business development process. With numerous testimonials praising the success they have enjoyed from the program, students are developing strong businesses that can continue to flourish for many years to come.\nTo date, the business has not experienced any seasonality, with sales consistent throughout the year. However, given the nature of the business, there could be an opportunity prior to, and during, the holidays to target students looking for a little extra cash to spend on holiday gifts. With a high average order value of ~$175 and content that is evergreen in nature, the gross margins are very high, leaving room to leverage profits for ad spend.\nOwnership & Staff\nAs the courses are made up of prerecorded content, staffing is minimal, and operations are a breeze. The company leverages 3 employees, consisting of 2 VAs that assist with log-ins, refunds, and FAQs, while an ex-student provides answers to student questions. Having a former student address current student questions allows for valuable, spot-on feedback to the owner while also positioning his experience with the program as a living testament to the effectiveness of the program.\nThe owner works just 2 to 3 hours per week. His time is typically spent answering questions from the customer service team and experimenting with Facebook advertising.\nMarketing\nTestimonials contribute to a large part of the success of the company. Students hearing of other students’ success in the program is a natural selling point. About 3 students per day reach out to the company to let them know that they have closed a new client of their own. Many of these students are earning $7,500 to $9,000 a month, leveraging the skills taught in the program.\nThe company’s marketing strategy is fairly simplistic, consisting exclusively of paid ads on Facebook. Facebook ads plus word-of-mouth traffic provide an average unique visitor rate of over 7,500 every month and the business has accumulated over 7,000 email contacts during its brief existence.\nScale Opportunities\nGrowth opportunities abound. The current owner has taken a fairly conservative approach to Facebook advertising as he does not have much expertise in this area. There is also minimal content on the company’s website. Implementing an SEO strategy should provide a good chunk of organic traffic, while advertising on  TikTok and YouTube could provide significant traffic. Social media, in general, should be fertile ground for the demographic this business is targeting. Influencer marketing, especially with former students, should be a natural growth opportunity, as would an affiliate marketing program.\nThe owner has just started experimenting with email marketing, with test email blasts generating about $4,000 in additional income. Exploiting this marketing channel with upsells, cross-sells and new services would provide a new avenue of growth at minimal cost.\nThe company currently provides a one-time charge service. There are opportunities to build recurring revenue streams via ongoing coaching, access to mastermind groups and/or a continuing education program, adding monthly video content, training and webinars.\nSummary\nThe future is bright for this young business. The global eLearning market was valued at an impressive $250.8 billion in 2020 and is predicted to rise at a CAGR of 10.5% to hit $457.8 billion by 2026. Additionally, the growth of the gig economy has made the idea of being your own boss much more top of mind. The company’s main demographic, individuals looking for a side hustle that could potentially turn into a full-time job, fall well within these trends. There is a vast potential customer base looking for these types of opportunities. With a sizeable untapped market and virtually no competition, in the right buyer’s hands, this business could experience tremendous growth.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents an eCommerce Brand focused in the smartwatch Band Niche, making the most of the rapidly expanding smartwatch sector. The brand presently sells a number of products, with straps driving the majority of sales and accessories accounting for the rest. Braided nylon bands arethe best-selling items, likely because they were the first category launched by the brand. Management is currently working to scale the other categories as well.\nThe global smartwatch market was valued at $30,4 million in 2021 and is expected to grow immensely over the next decade. The devices are anticipated to witness a surge in adoption owing to the growing inclination for fitness tracking and health monitoring features. Smartwatches, like otherwearable devices, come packed with features such as calling, messaging, navigation, voice assistance, pairing with other connected devices, and more, enabling users to automate their daily activities. The market has experienced fundamental technological developments related to operating systems andinterfaces. Apple possesses the highest market share of more than 30% and is anticipated to retain its dominance in the future, adding immense value to this brand of compatible accessories.\nThe straps’ qualities – like breathability, toughness, stretch, style, and ability to be swiftly and efficiently changed with varied colors and designs have won the public’s affection and garnered a devoted following. Many customers order multiple variants for different occasions.\nAll products are sold under the brand name through its Shopify-built website and are stored at and fulfilled from the company’s 1,700-square-foot warehouse. On average, 440 orders are shipped daily.\nThe company makes use of a 100% stock inventory model. Management currently aims to maintain three months of inventory on hand. They are doing weekly ocean freight orders to sustain these levels. The company pays for goods as they are shipped but has been offered payment terms of net 30 and net60.\nPaid social media and a growing focus on PPC advertising drive the digital marketing strategy. When the brand started, advertising was done exclusively on Facebook. In September 2021, the team started running TikTok ads. Google PPC was initiated three months later with a focus on branded campaigns.Shopping campaigns became a more significant focus in the following months. Bing ads were then introduced at a meager scale and remain that way. More recently, the media buying agency has begun Snapchat and YouTube ads.\nAn email marketing agency restructured the flows in mid-2022 and now creates ten monthly campaigns. The agency and management are confident they will get emails to account for 30% of revenue, reducing advertising costs and delivering an impressive return on investment. The database is now over 78,000 and growing swiftly.\nAt the same time, the company launched a Creator Program. An agency was hired to help build the program to easily manage it with systems and tech stacks. The brand already had 260 applicants in the first week and accepted 60. The strategy behind the campaign is to generate enormous volumes of user-generated content for ads on social media.\nAdditional methods management is testing to scale the operation include listing on Amazon. The first shipment was sent to Amazon at the beginning of June totest out FBA.\nThe two owners spend around 20 to 30 hours weekly on the business, primarily overseeing the agencies and customer service team, developing new products,and managing the warehouse.\nIn addition, six full-time employees are based in the US, and two are in the Philippines. They work in the following capacities:\nAdditionally, the company uses four agencies. One creates video ads and lifestyle photos, another handles media buying for Facebook, TikTok, Google, Microsoft, Snapchat, and YouTube. The third creates monthly email campaigns, while the fourth works on ongoing website optimization.\nNo special skills are required to operate this business, and all staff can stay on with the business post-acquisition. The existing owners strongly believe in what they have created and are willing to maintain between 30 and 40 percent of the business with the right capital partner.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a well-managed company in the Beauty & Personal Care market. With nearly a full decade’s worth of experience acting as their foundation in the B2C market, they have put their know-how to use in the creation of their own brand of eyelash extensions for both personal and professional use.\nThe global eyelash extension industry now sits at a comfortable $1.5 billion in annual sales within the beauty care industry, in part thanks to the increasing number of customers who are interested in exploring extensions on their own terms, or looking to beauty professionals for help trying them out.\nMuch like with the Beauty & Personal Care industry, the primary demographic for the eyelash extension market is women. Something worth noting, however, is that there have been a rising number of male customers taking an interest in getting their lashes done as well, with many people coming to treat getting their lashes styled at a salon in the same way they would their hair. Good quality lash extensions give volume to a consumer’s natural eyelashes, giving them an easy and accessible way of improving their appearance.\nStudies have found that about 70% of eyelash stylists now earn over $50,000 every year, with 74% being either an esthetician or licensed cosmetologist. The rise in pay and popularity has made eyelash care and maintenance a far more viable career for many budding beauticians, which means that the demand for comfortable, high-quality extensions in a professional setting has spiked.\nThe company’s own eyelash extensions have inspired a devoted following, with many reviews of their products claiming how hard it is to stop using them once the customers try them for the first time. Their Repeat Order Rate now sits at a remarkable 75%, which shows that these comments absolutely hold weight.\nBesides the excellent quality of their extensions, one of the primary factors behind their strong Repeat Order Rate is that their eyelashes have a natural shed cycle, with one lash hair falling out roughly every 4 to 6 weeks. Since the lashes aren’t permanent, customers are encouraged to return to the company to buy another set, in order to maintain their eyelashes’ volume. They cater to a wide range of customers, from Do-It-Yourselfers trying to take a more direct role in their beauty care, and beauty parlors, salons, and other professionals in the field that use their company’s products for their jobs. Since so many different demographics can enjoy their extensions, sales have stayed incredibly healthy, and put them in a great place to scale.\nThe company established themselves in 2014, and has benefited greatly from the fact that their products are made exclusively for their brand. They have also ensured that they receive a steady stream of supply throughout the year thanks to their brand planning centering around sourcing diversification, with their suppliers being based across 5 main countries: one of which is the US.\nTheir adhesives and glues, which see regular recurring use among customers, have grown into some of the company’s top products, and now make up for 33% of their total profits. The rest of their sales are fairly evenly distributed across the rest of the 300+ SKUs available on their Shopify website.\nThe brand, though popular for their lash extensions, haven’t restricted themselves to selling just them, however. They have, over the years, expanded into other DIY products such as liquid eyeliner pens, eyelash growth serum, and eyelash extension cleansers and mascara. The company also now has 8 eLearning classes in place that are available for aspiring stylists and entrepreneurs, which teach them how to properly apply lash extensions on their customers.\nToday, they have well over 55,000 clients in their B2C sales, with no one client accounting for more than 2% of their total revenue. Their strong customer diversification means that even if a client decides to purchase their products elsewhere, they’ll see very little decline in their profit. They have firmly established themselves as a top provider of high-quality lash extensions, which gives them an edge in a market that has seen a surge of interest from new lash artists, beauty salon customers, and other <lashpreneurs=. They hit their highest ever monthly revenue in November of last year, and their sales have stayed consistent throughout the year.\nThe company established their own Amazon storefront in February of 2021, which has also proven successful. They sell over 50 SKUs through this channel, and though their Average Order Value still sits at $70 as opposed to Amazon’s $15, it is quickly growing in both profit and customers with each passing day. They sell through Seller Central, and have used PPC ads on their site to attract a fresh influx of customers.\nThough selling from Amazon comes with many benefits, one of the best for the company’s long-term growth is their easy access to global expansion. Amazon has many different storefronts across international markets, which the company could use to see an immense rise in scale.\nThey generate additional streams of profit from the variety of sales channels that they’ve established, with 10% of their profits coming from subscriptions, and another 10% being derived from their Mobile App. They have also created a rewards program on their Shopify website, which has strengthened their Repeat Order Rate by encouraging customers to return and take advantage of the many benefits that the program offers.\nThe company’s Shopify fulfillment is managed in-house, with the small, lightweight nature of their SKUs making the storage and shipment process simple and affordable. They only require about a floor area of about 20 by 40 feet in warehouse space for their 400,000 total units, which gives them a decent amount of space to work with. Their Amazon inventory is handled through Fulfillment by Amazon, which further lightens their workload and storage needs.\nThey use several reliable advertising methods for their marketing plan, which makes it easy for them to target new customers and promote upsells to their current client base. This strategy uses a cultured brand strategy and message to appeal to their core demographic, beauty professionals, and has been so effective that their Repeat Order Rate is close to hitting 80% in the near future.\nThe brand runs several PPC advertisements on Google alongside their Amazon ads, and make consistent use of their over 39,000 active strong email database with a campaign that sends out about 1 to 2 emails every week. They use a similar strategy for their SMS text messaging campaigns, which give the company a more direct line to their customer base and their attentions. Their campaigns are structured around flows to auto-manage their clients’ behavior, making for a more efficient advertising process.\nThe company has a thriving social media presence on several popular platforms, with their Pinterest account having over 78,000 monthly views, over 95,000 followers on Instagram, and over 120,300 on Facebook. Their regular activity on these sites has given them a steady flow of organic traffic, and let them shine a spotlight on their excellent products.\nThey also use an SEO program, having made their products easier to find through search engines through the use of keywords for their PPC campaigns. The company supplements this with an active blog on their website with over 150 articles which, combined with their other tactics, has led to over 200,000 unique visitors to their website every month.\nManagement is highly turn-key, with the current owner needing only about 15 to 20 hours per week to run the business. Their daily operations are largely handled by a team of five employees, consisting of a full-time customer success manager, a marketing project manager, a supply chain manager, and 2 warehouse/packaging overseers.\nThe Beauty & Personal Care market is rampant in its success, not unlike this incredible acquisition. They have a solid reputation among their B2B and DTC customers, a tight-knit network of suppliers around the world, and a bright future in the hands of the right buyer.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a dynamic, fast-growing online garment retailer, which is laying waste to the screen printing industry.\nThe business is an eCommerce store that sells heat transfer designs direct to consumer as well as to other online retailers. The store is showing tremendous growth, in line with the booming print-on- demand industry. It has terrific margins on its $100 average order value.\nWhen designs are created using screen printing, actual screens are necessary to print the designs. Special screens are used to create a stencil, and ink is spread over it. The ink will pass through the stencil and print on the t-shirt only in places the stencil allows. With screen printing, you can only use one color at a time. You may need multiple stencils or screens to have a multi-colored design on the shirt. This drastically increases material and labor costs.\nHeat transfers, however, are done differently. Custom prints can be created and applied to almost anything, from t-shirts to tablecloths. Heat transfers combine heat and pressure to print designs. Their popularity is primarily driven by the fact that one can buy the design and shirt separately and only print when a customer orders. As a result, inventory can be kept at a minimum, and there is no risk of overstocking a product that may not sell as anticipated, freeing up cash flow and lowering the financial barrier to entry.\nThe business uses a simple yet effective three-step process when deciding what products to sell:\nProduct sourcing is mainly from two Chinese factories that only print heat transfers for this company, exclusively. The factory can also manufacture unique appliques like rhinestones, foil, and glitter. The manufacturers are restricted from selling the artwork to anyone else. In addition, the Chinese factory only produces heat transfers for this company. 100% of fulfillment is executed from the New London, CT warehouse, and sales are consistent throughout the year. Top-selling heat transfer products change regularly based on holidays, events, or trends. Some all-time hero products include t-shirts with political, faith-based, and humorous designs and slogans. The typical customer is US-based and split around 60% female and 40% male. They spend, on average, $100 per order and re-order regularly.\nLead generation for this primary business is achieved through various methods. Facebook and Instagram drive most sales. Many campaigns are based on upcoming events such as Black Friday, Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and St Patrick’s Day. The budget is split based on the season or what management wishes to push. The broad strategy encompasses standard ads, retargeting, videos, carousels of best-selling products, and testimonials. Across the board, the efforts result in a 4 to 6 return on ad spend (ROAS).\nAdditional marketing comprises PPC advertising. This includes search, brand name, retargeting, and feed campaigns.\nThe owner works only 3-6 hours weekly, liaising with his team. This acquisition opportunity is a real work-from-home business with sophisticated processes and systems in place. The next owner will enjoy working with a group of motivated professionals committed to delivering outstanding results.\nA buyer requires few special skills. However, they should be operational with good management abilities. Taking care of the people in place will keep everything running smoothly as the business prepares for a 30% revenue increase this year. A moderate understanding of finance and the ability to work with budgets would be helpful.",

The company focuses on nicotine, alcohol, and marijuana-related tests and accessories for parents of teenagers, employers, governments and schools, and other test kits can be added over time.\nSmoking and vaping among adolescents is an issue affecting families nationwide. Alcohol and substance abuse among teens remains an issue that testing can help identify and address. Students involved in extracurricular activities and subject to in-school drug testing reported less substance use than comparable students in schools without drug testing. One approach is for students and their parents to agree to test for drugs, tobacco, or alcohol randomly as a condition of participation in certain activities. Given the growth in access to drugs, alcohol and other substances in both adolescents and workers, there is no question that these test kits are needed and have a bright future as that access broadens.\nAll primary products for this Brand are manufactured exclusively for the Company by an Asian supplier with whom the owners have worked for 10+ years. 95% of sales are derived from the company’s own brand-name products. The 5% balance is from related products obtained from other companies. The business usually holds around $20,000 worth of inventory in its small office. In addition, it stocks ~ $100,000 at a California-based 3PL.\nAmazon accounts for 75% of all revenue, with 22% coming from its Branded Website, and the remaining 3% from eBay and Walmart combined.\nTop-selling products include combination urine tests for nicotine, THC, and alcohol, saliva nicotine-only tests, and urine nicotine-only tests. Supplementary products, such as Bluing tabs—used to prevent the adulteration of urine samples—are also highly popular.\nThe average order value on Amazon is $26 across 138 ASINs. That figure jumps to $50 across 75 products on the company website.\nSales are relatively consistent throughout the year, with peaks aligning with school programs. As a result, sales experience a slight lull during holiday periods. Thanksgiving through New Year tends to be slowest since parents are the primary purchasers and tend to buy less when kids spend more time under their supervision.\nThe typical customer is a 40-year-old mother of a teen worried about substance abuse. They are willing to pay a slight premium for a more accurate test kit.\nDigital marketing efforts are minor, with a small budget on Google. Subsequently, there is ample opportunity to boost sales through various endeavors.\nSince most of the company’s traffic and conversions stem from the Amazon Platform, a review of that Account is helpful. Most of their star reviews range from 4.5 – 5 Stars and they have thousands of product reviews in place. Showing 20 Parent SKUs and a wide variety of child variations most of their products are Prime, thus subject to Amazon FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) logistics. The products also rank quite well organically for industry leading keywords associated with each product sold.\nThe owner works only ten hours weekly on the business, focusing primarily on inventory management, the guidance of large orders, and supervision of packing and shipping staff. By putting in more time, a new owner can look to vastly expand the business given the fact that the foundation is already set to expand from here.\nPart-time staff, working ten hours or fewer weekly, include a shipping clerk, packing clerk, and a piece- work packing clerk.\nOrders are delivered from the company office and its 3PL. Generally, between three and four FBA shipments are made weekly from the 3PL. The small local warehouse fulfills Shopify orders but the owner is arranging for most website orders to be fulfilled by Amazon.\nA key selling point of the business is that our lending partners at Website Closers have Pre-Approved this business for an SBA 7(a) Loan, which allows a Qualified Buyer to acquire the business for as little as 10% down with the SBA loan amortized over 10 years. As a result, surplus cash flow can be used for expansion or other pursuits while anew owner can enjoy a stable income and a faster return on the investment\nFew special skills are required to run this highly systemized business, and a new owner can move into an operational role in short order. And with the SBA process in play, a buyer can be comforted by the fact that a bank and a 3rd party evaluation team is involved to ensure the business is up to their highly rigorous standards. A brief study of drugs and drug abuse and some knowledge of drug testing can be learned in a single day. eCommerce operations can be taught in 1-2 days. The current owner is highly motivated to assist a buyer with a seamless transition and ensure continued success and profitability.",

And this is no ordinary brand – this is one of those product lines that, when you see it, you recognize the brand immediately – something many other brands fail to capture. That brand development is just one of the many exciting factors that make this a great acquisition target.\nThe company has a robust direct-to-consumer and business-to-business sales platform, excellent margins, and a commitment to creating accessories that make women feel chic, sophisticated, and comfortable wherever life takes them.\nThe inspiration for the products was born on an international flight, so it’s no coincidence that travel is at the brand’s heart. After boarding flights with organic cotton throws for comfort, the two owners realized that there had to be a better way to stay cozy on the go. They wanted something versatile, machine washable, and crafted from environmentally friendly organic cotton. What transpired was the flagship travel scarf as the solution, and customers immediately lauded the design for travel and everyday wear. From overseas vacations to Monday zoom calls, they reached for it as their go-to accessory to feel instantly put together. From there, management has added various popular silhouettes, colors, and fabrics.\nThe environmentally-friendly range was developed as an extension of the owners’ beliefs, but its impact has resulted in tremendous sales. Organic cotton production in 2019 and 2020 rose by 31% over the previous reporting period as consumers began to seek socially responsible products. 70% of consumers now say they want to know what brands are doing to address social issues and 46% pay close attention to a company’s social responsibility efforts before purchasing.\nThe company enjoys three revenue streams, all of which are growing.\neCommerce is the business’s fastest-growing division and has expanded from under $25,000 in 2019 to revenue of almost $2.3 million in 2022. Management has stabilized ad expenses to create profitable onboarding and a lucrative customer acquisition cycle.\nWholesale, too, has proven successful. The business has established relationships with more than 75 independent and specialty stores throughout the US and Canada, and that number is steadily climbing.\nAdditionally, the company is leveraging its market position as a leader in organic cotton textiles to create key account collaborations. Ongoing seasonal partnerships with prominent furniture and home décor stores, high-end shopping malls, and premier baby and children’s brands have proven profitable and drastically increased brand exposure.\nAll products are sold under the brand name, and non-compete agreements and vendor routing guides with suppliers prevent them from selling the designs elsewhere. This thriving lifestyle brand imports and sells its textiles directly through the eCommerce site and to strategic wholesale partners throughout the US.\nThe business makes use of a 100% stock inventory model. Typically, 30 to 90 days’ inventory is maintained at the 1,000-square-foot warehouse. Major purchase orders are placed quarterly, with occasional additional orders based on how forecasts align with actual sales. Payment terms are 0% down and the total amount before BOL release.\nThe typical customer is a female between 35 and 54, ranging from urban to suburban. She enjoys dining out, traveling, and is interested in fashion trends, beauty, and wellness. She is a frequent online shopper, uses a mobile phone to make purchases, regularly visits Facebook, and has a lifetime value of $112.\nSales are steady throughout the year, with peaks in October through December. Key gift giving holidays such as Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day are also busy, while day-to-day sales increase in the summer as more people travel.\nThe digital marketing strategy primarily involves advertising on Facebook, Instagram, and Google. Additional marketing tactics include video marketing, seasonal sales, ‘Buy More, Save More’ offers, and post-purchase upsells. These efforts achieve a 300 to 500 percent ROAS—depending on the time of year— and drive 58,000 monthly visitors to the website.\nCustomer acquisition costs around $30, and these numbers have allowed the company to remain profitable even during the customer acquisition phases.\nThe two directors work primarily on more significant company planning and management of the marketing teams. One is in charge of operations and finance, while the other oversees brand creativity and marketing. The business has been set up to continue thriving without the existing owners or needing to hire staff to replace them.\nA full-time operations manager oversees all operational aspects of the business, including manufacturing, quality control, importing, and wholesale distribution. She manages the relationship with the 3PL to ensure they adhere to all established contractual fulfillment obligations. Furthermore, her duties include:\nA final employee works part-time in customer service, assisting with all tickets, responding to online social media comments, and managing website reviews.\nAgencies are used for social media ad management, web development, and email marketing.\nThis business has consistently shown year-over-year growth and has unlimited proliferation opportunities for an ambitious buyer. Excellent systems, relationships, financials, and an insatiable customer appetite for its products attest to the promising future of this listing.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a seasoned online retailer in the lucrative perfume vertical. This eCommerce company operates primarily on Amazon and has enjoyed success for over a decade. Products appeal to all ages, genders, and demographics and, as a result, have stood the test of time, which is particularly pertinent during the current economic climate.\nThe global perfume market was valued at $50.85 billion in 2022 and is expected to continue growing at a healthy rate. The demand for fragrances is attributed to the rising trend of personal grooming and the increasing demand for luxury and exotic fragrances. Moreover, increasing consumer spending on premium and lavish perfumes due to the high-income level and improving living standards drive the industry worldwide. In recent years, perfumes have evolved into a significant cosmetics and personal care sector. They have emerged as an essential product due to the growing trend of personal care, forming a part of pride and confidence.\nThe company purchases all products through wholesalers. Orders are placed from several vendors on a weekly or semi-weekly basis. Payment terms are typically net 30.\nThe business makes use of a 100% stock inventory model. All inventory is stored in-house or at Amazon warehouses, where 20% of orders are fulfilled. The company ships 100 to 120 orders daily from its 2000- square-foot facility.\nThe business currently has around $1.8 million in inventory, and management has strategically increased those levels yearly. Typically, an additional loan is taken out annually to house more stock during the Christmas season. This is necessary as sales soar by 500% over the year-end holiday period. Amazon has a loan program that the business utilizes to increase sales when demand is rife. Additional sales peaks occur on Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, and Prime Day\nThe owner operates the business and chiefly focuses on listing products, ordering, and customer service. Four additional staff take care of the operational aspect of the company. Their primary job is shipping orders to customers.\nThe company’s prestige, financials, and glowing reviews demonstrate its authority in the personal care sector. Given that it has never pursued any marketing endeavors, scale opportunities are vast and could skyrocket revenue to new heights.\nLow-hanging fruit to boost sales is maintaining sufficient inventory. Although the brand has been actively increasing levels year after year, it regularly runs out of top-selling products. Subsequently, sales are squandered, rankings are affected, and repeat customer rates presumably decline. With astute stock management, sales and profits will increase with minimal effort.\nExpanding into the skincare category is a potentially rewarding opportunity. Skincare is a prevalent segment, accounting for 33% of the beauty and personal care market. Pursuing this growth path would provide an additional revenue stream and enable the business to initiate the highly sought-after subscription model while cross-selling and up-selling products.\nSince the current reviews will immediately help products rank, expanding sales to more locations is plain sailing. The brand has begun Amazon expansion to Brazil, Canada, and Mexico and should consider exploring additional regions where the perfume market is growing most rapidly.\nThe company could easily create a Shopify store. Through search engine advertising, a vigorous social media campaign, affiliate marketing, and influencer relationships, selling through a brand website would undoubtedly increase margins, promote a plethora of new marketing initiatives, and obtain an undiscovered prospective customer base. The company would also be able to compile a sizable email and SMS database for inexpensive advertising to publicize sales, endorse new items, foster client loyalty, and upsell customers at the point of purchase. Logistics would be straightforward, considering the business already ships 80% of orders from its warehouse.\nInfluencers reign supreme in the personal care, cosmetics, and beauty markets. Focused campaigns on TikTok and Instagram can significantly increase earnings if used wisely and could readily be managed by a social media agency or a dedicated employee.\nThis acquisition opportunity is primed for growth under capable stewardship willing to explore any of the abundant scale prospects available to them.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a successful CPG Brand that offers Vitamins & Supplements, primarily on the Amazon.com platform. The company offers a wide array of all types of supplements in a variety of forms, including gummy, capsule, liquids and powders. Their large selection and variety provides the company with the opportunity to maximize its exposure across the entire vitamins and supplements ecosystem and most demographics within it.\nCurrently they are focused on Immunity, Essential Wellness, Brain, Mood, Men’s & Women’s Wellness, and Beauty. They are thriving with a 4-year history of exceptional profitability in the online nutrition sector. In that time, the brand has expertly garnered customers through its Amazon FBA Account and created a well-designed DTC Shopify Website.\nThe mission of this company has been in place from the start – to help consumers live healthier and happier lives, which is why the team researches and crafts only premium ingredients for their products. These include capsules and gummies that assist with energy, stress, digestion, heart health, and weight management.\nThis brand blends extensive research with manufacturing inventions to find popular SKUs with fewer barriers to markets. Additionally, they depend primarily on Amazon-specific software to design new product\nimplementation strategically and effectively. All goods are bought from only the highest quality facilities who acquire the world’s best ingredients locally and abroad.\nThe company is well-known and reliable, especially for their gummy offerings. They have developed into an industry leader, consistently drawing strong traffic and conversions, month after month. They also have a significant amount of recurring revenue through repeat sales of their supplements via Amazon’s Subscribe and Save platform.\nManagement utilizes a DropShipping model. They have excellent payment terms with suppliers who ship directly to FBA facilities. The eCommerce giant holds almost all stock, and between eight weeks and a year of SKUs are stored there. Stock levels are managed to continually be available and reach a quarter of a million dollars during peak season.\nThe brand has outstanding margins, a $17 AOV, and appeals to a wide customer base with its efficient and cost-effective products. Furthermore, the company sells everything Prime and has an excellent rating. The company is currently in the process of yet another new SKU launch, with multiple additional products in R&D.\nThe owners work only 10 hours weekly combined and require no staff. Tasks primarily include managing finances and inventory, R&D, marketing, design, and fulfilling occasional orders from the Shopify-built website.\nThe industry is expanding rapidly as more individuals become aware of the value of including nourishing components in their diets. Due to an increasing workforce and evolving lifestyles, people worldwide find it difficult to meet daily nutrient requirements, which is predicted to be a compelling cause for the market’s augmentation. The industry is further anticipated to be driven by rising reliance on supplements to meet nutrient needs due to their efficacy and accessibility.\nDespite the company’s accomplishments, there remain numerous prospects to scale. Excellent expansion potential exists for new owners both on and off Amazon. Given the current owners’ marketing inexperience, this company could grow significantly with effective advertising across existing platforms and secondary alternatives. Just a small portion of total revenue comes via the D2C website, and as a result, it offers a vast area for proliferation and the chance for fresh blood to boost profits while bringing in significant traffic. A buyer could dramatically scale the business with wholesale or supplying brick-and-mortar retailers. Health shops, as an example, could present an additional source of income, while white-labeling products for other online sellers are low-hanging fruit.\nA straightforward move is to explore digital advertising, including the use of affiliates. This presents a performance-based option with little investment but potentially lucrative returns. An aggressive social media campaign, particularly partnerships with health and wellness influencers, has proven itself in this vertical.\nLaunching a strategy to grow the email database and implement segmented campaigns should also be considered for higher conversions, increasing subscription services, and optimizing customer acquisition costs.\n",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents an eCommerce Brand that is riding high on a fast-growing vertical, Men’s Skincare and Grooming Products. Having developed their own proprietary produce line, the company quickly found an audience, resulting in strong, growing sales and glowing customer reviews.\nTheir rapid success positions this brand for enormous scale opportunities, making this acquisition even more attractive to a buyer. Having operated for nearly three years on their Shopify website, the company is ready to bring their listings to the millions of customers using eCommerce titans such as Amazon and Walmart.\nHaving mastered the development of products that customers make a part of their daily grooming habits, the company has the savvy and industry know-how to launch new items in a field that ranges from hair and skin care to shaving devices and anti-aging creams. They have a lot to teach other entrepreneurs about how to successfully operate in a niche space and become a leader in it.\nFor decades, hair and skin care products were designed for and marketed mainly to women consumers, with the assumption that men just wanted the basics, such as a straight razor. However, the field of male grooming has come of age today. There are more men’s salons in the country than ever before, and products are being designed especially for use by men. Ironically, many of these products are still being marketed to women as the ideal gift for the men in their lives.\nThe global men’s grooming products market was valued at $202.6 billion in 2022 and is projected to continue rising by 8% through 2030, as a rapidly increasing number of men have started spending heavy amounts of disposable income on grooming packages.\nSocial media has played a key role in this. Male celebrities touting the benefits of the latest hair, skin and shaving products that help them look their best are easy to find on sites such as Instagram and YouTube, which is driving profits for the industry significantly higher.\nThe global men’s grooming products market, valued at $202.6 billion today, will grow by 8% through 2030 as more men recognize the benefit of sophisticated skincare and haircare items, and more women decide to buy them as gifts.\nLaunched 2.5 years ago, the company developed its own men’s skincare products, most successfully a facial brush designed to eliminate razor bumps, dark marks and acne. This became a fast-selling product courtesy of their creative social media marketing, enabling them to develop several additional products such as a face wash, quench, and towel.\nThese products are 100% proprietary and manufactured directly for them, and one of their best scale opportunities moving forward is to expand their product line. They’re well positioned to do that, since the company has formulations ready for producing several new items. That includes two design patents and custom molds, and the ingredients to their formulations are proprietary as well.\nWith an Average Order Value of $86, their five SKUs deliver steady profits throughout the year, sales that are boosted by the fact that the men’s skincare vertical is growing so dramatically today, as more men become conscious of their personal appearance and seek out products that will enhance it. Their key demographics so far have been African American men between the ages of 25 and 44, who are buying mid-priced to high-end personal goods that also include their clothing and shoes. These skincare products have become another important investment for them.\nWhile their main brush sells for $69.99, upsells from their newest accessories have raised the lifetime value of their business to $115. Another key part of their growth has been the exclusive perks available to those customers who join their membership plan. Offers such as 25% off all future orders, early product access and access to all digital merchandise have sent their profits soaring as well.\nSocial media has been instrumental in their success, particularly the use of viral video marketing. The company has been most successful on TikTok, where they have 91,000+ followers and where millions have watched their videos showing how their products work, and in a fun and humorous way. These videos continue to attract new viewers and expand their customer base.\nThey now post up to 7 times a week on TikTok and Instagram, and their video content drives the most organic traffic to their website.\nThere are other tools in their digital marketing toolbox. PPC ads on Google and Facebook have driven sales higher as well, while their organic traffic comes from postings on sites such as Instagram, where they have 11,000+ followers, and Facebook (2,000+ followers). Their content marketing increases both their visibility and credibility and could be used just as effectively with new products. These posts and a blog on their website have helped to give the company 50,000+ unique monthly visitors to their website.\nWith an email database containing 37,000+ subscribers, direct mail marketing in the form of automated postcards has helped to increase revenue, and so have their SMS text messaging campaigns, which have resulted in a 50% email-to-phone number conversion rate. SMS automation has brought in 7.5% of their sales recently.\nThese tactics have started to boost the company’s Repeat Customer Rate, which just shot up to 11%\nWith contractors available to handle daily operations, the current ownership’s workload is now about 25 hours per week, with a focus on media buying, developing new ideas for videos, ordering inventory, and working on the design of their landing page.\nThe company uses a fulfillment center for inventory and shipping, and they typically place new inventory orders once a month to keep up with demand. This company is exceptionally well groomed for future success, having demonstrated their skill at finding their target audience, developing products that people want and establishing a clear foothold in a promising and profitable vertical.",

Those services include data center and server administration, web hosting, email hosting, web design and maintenance, and internet visibility—all with a personal touch. Additionally, the business provides an all-in-one solution when it comes to a client’s online presence, from provisioning, registering, and hosting a domain to SEO, SMO, PPC, and social media management. Clients can rely on the full-service model, knowing that they don’t have to think about their web presence, but can reap the benefits of an attractive, secure site that converts on the traffic generated for them.\nServices fall into four buckets—marketing, design, hosting, and eCommerce. Depending on the required services, billing is structured annually, monthly, once-off, or ad-hoc. Web hosting, domain names, and SSL certificates are billed annually and provide stable cash flow to the business, while email server and spam filter maintenance bring in consistent monthly revenue. One-time services include web design, DNS setup, website transfers, and logo creation. SEO, social media, and Google AdWords consultation is typically an ongoing service done as needed for clients.\nA quarter of the 130 active clients are also marketing clients, resulting in a minimum spend of $285 monthly over and above other services rendered.\nWith a quarter of century of business behind it, clients have a dependable and trusted name that will be there for them in the future. All sales, marketing, and design are provided to customers’ companies in-house. An example of why clients trust the company is its money-saving services, such as online training for staff to add and change website content. Another is its expedient service— transferring an existing website to its hosting is achieved in only 48 to 72 hours, while building a new website is executed in less than a month.\nClients are invited to call or sit with their designer to have their needs understood and ensure that service and design expectations are met. The team is willing to travel, as necessary, to any client’s site depending on their requests and specific needs.\nSeveral methods drive revenue. Referrals are a rich source of new business owing to the longevity of the company and the consistently excellent service it has provided customers over the years. Management is also active in local business groups. It uses networking efficiently by teaching seminars on digital marketing, social media, Google Analytics, and data mining.\nThe typical customer is a business of any size, budget, and industry. If they need web hosting, this company will provide it. The company has clients all around the USA. Being headquartered in New Jersey, about 70% of revenue is realized from the surrounding area, with the remainder spread nationwide. The business is easily relocatable.\nThe two owners work around 45 hours combined weekly. One manages all services and PPC advertising. The other handles administration such as bookkeeping, payroll, and personnel, as well as client activities such as managing Facebook groups, creating newsletters, and enhancing SEO.\nAdditional staff includes a full-time SEO Specialist, web designer, and writer, and a part-time social media specialist. The business is fully remote and experiences no seasonality, allowing for logistical simplicity and maximum efficiency of operations.\nThe company likes to think of itself as a firm that offers nearly everything anyone could need regarding its internet presence. Management has not been interested in growing the company for years as it has become a comfortable lifestyle for them, offering instantaneous augmentation possibilities for an ambitious buyer. The owners regularly turn away business and intentionally refrain from soliciting additional business because of bandwidth. They would, however, be thrilled to turn that faucet on for a buyer.\nIn February 2023, the seller will resume doing Google seminars on data analysis and AdWords in Southern and Central New Jersey and five surrounding counties. Leads from these seminars for Google have historically been incredibly solid, with a high conversion rate and will be passed along to the new owner.\nThe owners are motivated to assist a buyer with a seamless transition. They are willing to stay on for three to six months to ensure continued success.",

The global nutritional supplements industry, valued at $151.9 billion in 2021 and growing by 8.9%, is enjoying continued success among consumers looking to increase their lifespan, stay healthy and feel better. And now that these products can all be evaluated and purchased online, re-ordering is also much easier. Most supplement companies, like this one, enjoy strong repeat order rates due to the ongoing nature of taking supplements.\nThe company specializes in the nice field of Probiotics, and quickly developed strong DTC and B2B sales over the past 14 years. The high volume of sales has enabled them to expand to 75 active SKUs, and they enjoy unlimited scale options through their distribution network. Today they are a globally recognized brand, and highly enthusiastic reviews from their customers have turned many of them into repeat buyers – so much so that they now have a huge 45% Repeat Customer Rate.\nThe Company has been evaluated by our Lending Partners and has been pre-qualified for a business loan to acquire the company. Qualified buyers can enjoy a 10-year amortization period, a low 10% down payment, and strong commercial interest rates.\nThe company is operating in a very lucrative vertical. The global probiotics market was valued at $58 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow by 7.5% through 2030, driven by increasingly high consumer demand for supplements that promote preventative care and can boost their immune system. The health benefits of probiotics have become clear through medical studies, and consumers leading busy lives want the ability to easily access products that serve as immune system boosters.\nThat’s why this company has such a tremendous reputation in the probiotics niche space and is enjoying $1 million+ in revenue each year.\nThe products being sold were invented by an award-winning microbiologist, and they are branded and sold under a perpetual licensing agreement through the exact match domain the company controls. Character mark, design, slogan, labels, physical products, and verbiage are all licensed and protected, making this an enviable opportunity for a buyer to acquire a business that is reputable and stable, has grown in strength to become one of the market leaders in its niche, and is attracting thousands of unique visitors every month.\nThey have an ideal catalog of SKUs, with no drastic concentration of sales on any given item besides the two wildly successful flagship products.\nTheir wholesale accounts are solid. The business was built on its main product line, and it has subsequently included additional products on various online storefronts. This brand has consistently made a name for itself with print and television appearances that have been running for more than a decade, while their email subscribers provide them with opportunities to introduce new projects and enjoy upsells to their existing customers.\nAs a result of their marketing, this company receives more than 10,000 unique average visitors monthly to its DTC eCommerce storefronts.\nSince the probiotics industry continues expanding on a global basis, this company has enormous growth opportunities moving forward, added to the fact that consumers are becoming far more health-conscious in general. The sector’s growth is explosive as more and more people realize the importance of healthy diets.\nThis company has consistently maintained year-over-year growth with little investment in paid marketing. Most of the website traffic and sales originate from their existing customer list, a direct online search for the brand, and residuals from the supplier’s marketing and promotional efforts. The website domain has recently been converted into an exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide, and fully transferable license from that supplier.\nThe exclusive agreement and partnership provides a unique opportunity for the business to benefit from its supplier’s corporate product marketing initiatives, favorable bulk pricing below wholesale, and access to retail and wholesale customer leads. In addition, they enjoy the benefits of $2 million in annual advertising without having to cover any of it.\nTheir typical D2C customer today is health conscious, between 18 and 54 years old, and split evenly between genders, with 54% of sales to men and the remaining 46% to women. They spend on average $114 and order frequently. Approximately 80% of the business is retail and 20% wholesale.\nThe company utilizes a 100% stock inventory model. A centrally located U.S. 3PL currently processes order fulfillment and is based in close proximity to the supplier, which provides fast inventory replacement and quick shipping throughout the U.S. In addition, the logistics company offers competitive pricing and fulfillment services.\nThe business is well-oiled operationally and does not require an extensive workload. The owner spends around 25 hours weekly on the company, focusing on:\nAdditionally, an operations manager handles almost all day-to-day tasks and is willing to stay with the new owner. A part-time nutritionist helps answer customer queries and provides professional advice as we respond to client emails and phone calls – she is also available to continue on with a new owner and has been with the company for a number of years.\nThere is an immense opportunity for a new owner to scale the operation. Some of the many methods available are mass retail, enhancing email marketing, international expansion, affiliate and performance-based marketing, and subscription models.\nA buyer with an established sales network can take this company to new heights through this channel, while one with other skill sets can steer the business in their chosen direction.\nThis business has the history, systems, customer loyalty, and licensing agreements that are beyond enviable, so it’s an enticing proposition for an ambitious buyer to scale the company quickly and vastly.\nThis is an opportunity of unmatched caliber in the segment, shipping directly to the customer through highly established and exact match domains.",

Products are sourced from two trusted, professional, and reliable suppliers. The groundwork has been laid for an operator at any level to step right in and enjoy passive cash flow from day one.\nBased in China and Hong Kong, the suppliers produce exceptionally high-quality products at exceptionally low prices. As a result, high retail profit margins are achieved by this business. Additionally, the owner has excellent relationships with these attentive and responsive manufacturers. Enticingly, more than 1,000 additional products exist in the catalog and can be added to the Amazon storefronts at any time. All are ready to be ordered for private labeling, allowing a buyer to expand and diversify the portfolio by adding new, complimentary items to scale and grow the business. Conveniently only two suppliers need to be dealt with for order placement, and they both ship directly to Amazon, avoiding the need for warehousing inventory and managing staff.\nThe suppliers sent final samples prior to starting the mass manufacturing process when the business began. The quality was flawless, and the owner has simply reordered as necessary since. The suppliers are aware of the sale of the company and the subsequent transition and are looking forward to email introductions with the new owner after closing.\nSince all stock is currently managed through Amazon FBA logistics, the process is hands-off, and the simplified model results in no workload for the operator to handle shipping or storage. Everything is outsourced to Amazon FBA warehouses to run on autopilot, and ample time, money, and effort are relieved with no need for office space or employees.\nAnother key selling point of the business is that inventory for the next three months has already been purchased. A new owner, therefore, can make the next inventory purchase from profits after taking over with absolutely no capital needed. All sales have been organic, and a buyer can immediately implement Amazon ads to boost sales and scale the profits. This is exceptionally low-hanging fruit and has only been avoided because of the existing owner’s time constraints. The budget for ads is taken monthly from Amazon account balances and will allow an owner to see tremendous profitability before the next inventory order.\nUsually, orders are placed every three months. Within three weeks, the orders are sent directly to Amazon. The suppliers accept the usual payment terms of 50% upfront and the remaining 50% before shipping.\nNotably, the brands experience little seasonality in sales as people buy accessories year-round. There are spikes during Prime month and Q4 for the gift-giving holidays, including the Christmas season, but each month has been predictably strong since inception.\nSince all stock is currently managed through Amazon FBA logistics, the process is hands-off, and the simplified model results in no workload for the operator to handle shipping or storage.

Although customers are primarily in the higher income bracket, they appreciate the ease and simplicity of Amazon ordering and shipping.\nCurrently, the owner works only 1 to 2 hours weekly. Tasks include reading notifications once a week to stay updated with changes, announcements, and info sent to all sellers about the platform and reordering inventory on time so it runs smoothly.\nThe initial development stages and months included research and development preparation, and it took more time to develop systems correctly and to launch successfully. The juice was certainly worth the squeeze, though, as it’s now a turnkey setup where Amazon FBA takes care of all logistics. The owner eliminated all the noise by design with immaculate execution.\nNo prior experience in the space is required of a new owner, and the seller is motivated and willing to train a buyer for a smooth transition to support the new owner’s success. Scale opportunities are abundant and can be outsourced by an owner without expertise or time or alternatively run in-house. The most apparent methods include Amazon advertising, influencer marketing, an aggressive social media campaign, introducing additional products, building Shopify websites for both brands, and selling internationally.",

There is no “one size fits all” when approaching lead generation. Today there are more methods than ever to target and track prospective customers. The experienced team at this company brings the expertise and resources to execute custom strategies that will be most effective for each client. Campaigns are optimized continuously to increase the volume and quality of leads.\nRevenue is driven in several ways. Firstly, generating leads and selling them at a fixed cost, secondly, generating leads and working on a retainer basis and finally, generating leads and working on a hybrid retainer and success fee basis.\nThe initial process is four-fold and involves the following:\n1.

The owner works only two to three hours weekly on the business. His primary tasks include reviewing ad spending, margins, and lead volume to scale. Two additional employees work in customer service.\nThe business uses various strategies to customize campaigns. One such key method is driving traffic to a website by getting ranked highly in search engine results for targeted keywords and phrases. While this approach takes some time to achieve optimal rankings, there is tremendous lead generation opportunity for holding those positions. Increasing traffic from users proactively seeking a client’s offerings can provide a steady flow of quality leads without advertising.\nThe business also utilizes platforms like Google AdWords, Bing, Facebook, and LinkedIn to quickly gain mass exposure to precisely targeted audiences. These certified professionals are experts at creating effective ads and leveraging the tools within each platform to optimize targeting and performance. Furthermore, the company continuously monitors the results and refines campaigns to yield the best return on ad spending.\nSocial Media can be the most significant driver of leads if managed effectively. However, many businesses need help with how to approach this medium. The experienced team has expertise in developing the right strategies for each brand, amplifying reach, and driving a lucrative flow of social-referral traffic back to the client’s website.\nGaining exposure in the media is a highly effective means of building credibility and visibility for a brand. By leveraging experts within an organization, the team works to position clients as a resource for all types of media channels. This exposure can frequently lead to additional direct inquiries compounding results. When prospective customers see a brand quoted in a major publication, it adds much more confidence to their decision to buy from it.\nEmail can be a very efficient way to reach new prospects and help nurture existing ones. This makes it a valuable component of Drip Marketing campaigns, and management tailors the approach based on each client. This may include identifying lists to market to, developing creative, and implementing and optimizing tools to automate the lead nurturing process.\nWith more than 80% of consumers researching on the web before making a purchase, a compelling website is as essential today for every business as a storefront is to a retail store. However, aesthetics aren’t enough. The team works with its clients to develop eye-catching sites, offer resourceful content, are search engine and user-friendly, optimized for lead conversion, and built for a presentation.\nIf most sales managers had their way, their teams would spend their days selling, not prospecting. These customers seek this team’s expertise to manage their telesales process to engage new prospects and get them to commit to facing time with their sales professionals. Email marketing landing pages are frequently leveraged to maximize these campaigns’ effectiveness.\nTwo essentials to getting a return on leads are immediate follow-up and scoring and nurturing leads with longer sales cycles. Only some sales organizations have the tools and resources to manage these processes effectively. By working in complement to a team and helping implement automation to help make a lead generation program even more successful, this business has achieved astonishing results.\nThis company has the client base, team, expertise, and structures that have allowed them to achieve great success and are designed for continued expansion going forward.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a B2B eCommerce Brand in the Outdoor Living Vertical. The company manufactures and imports one-of-a-kind Outdoor Living & small-format Outdoor Storage & Gardening products made of decay-resistant solid wood. Products are developed in-house and are manufactured based on in-house specifications by various factories overseas. All products are branded with the Company’s Trademarked Brand. The company sets the standard for high-quality, original items at a great value for their customers — allowing their retail partners to benefit through higher margins.\nAll products are functional, well-designed, and attractive, and are proven, sellers. They are packed unassembled (RTA), with easy-to-follow assembly instructions inside the package, and ready to drop ship anywhere in North America using a networkof 3PLs. The current product selection consists of 120 SKUs with new SKUs being developed and launched every year.\nThis brand has significant accomplishments in this niche space. As a thriving B2B company, they have taken on some major clients, including Big Box giants such as Target, Home Depot, Lowes, Walmart, and The Shopping Channel. The enterprise has spent more than a decade cultivating the support and appreciation of these major retailers, who know their customers love the brand’s outdoor and gardening products made of decay-resistant wood. In fact, their products sell in such high volume for their B2B clients that the company enjoys a 100% Repeat Order Rate. This customer loyalty has enabled the company to push more aggressively for DTC sales through their Amazon platform, where they now offer 120+ SKUs givingcustomers plenty of variety when it comes to selecting the right items for their homes. They have additional advantages … their sales are popular across North America in both the United States and Canada, and new clients are being added regularly as their reputation for excellence grows.\nThe Outdoor Living industry is an enormously profitable one, projected to reach $2.9 billion by 2028. A survey by the National Kitchen & Bath Association for 2020-21 showed that interest in outdoor living projects had grown by 65% in the U.S., with high demand for outdoor kitchen setups, patios & decks, and screened porches & three season rooms. The days of patios with two lawn chairs and a small table are over as people now want their backyards to be an extension of their homes, a place to relax and escape from daily pressures. A review of this brand’s history will demonstrate that they were well ahead of the curve in this vertical.\nThey specialize in one-of-a-kind SKUs.Launched 12 years ago, this business was ideally positioned to benefit from not just the rise in demand for Outdoor Living Products, but the rise in the use of online means to buy these heavy products. From the start, their products were manufactured to offer homeowners a major advantage by creating outdoor living and small format storage and gardening products because they’re made of decay-resistant wood.\nManufactured for this company in various factories and based on their specifications, they offer a number of high-volume movers with an Average Order Size of $350. Sales are strong throughout the year, picking up considerably from March through July and then again during the holidays. With new SKUs being added every year, the company has ample opportunity to continue expanding their customer base, as their products have become highly appealing to consumers shopping online for mid-range and stylish natural wood products for the home.\nTheir B2B Base is growing fast.The company’s many retail partners list the company’s products on their website, and most orders are drop-shipped one unit at a time to individual customers on behalf of those partners. Among the 20+ clients they work with, they now include Wayfair, Hayneedle, Overstock, Houzz, Cymax, Macy’s, and HBC.\nThose retailers are very successful in selling their products and the sky is the limit on the number of products that can be sold through these retailers. Once you are in the door and have proven the quality of your product, adding new products is much easier. The company has recently had additional retailers (Ashley Furniture, Pottery Barn, Belk Stores, etc.) reach out to them expressing interest in a new partnership.\nThe company has retained 100% of their clients as they focus on original outdoor products. A major scale opportunity for this company would be to create additional products in new categories, including outdoor deep seating, outdoor dining, outdoor cooking (BBQs and firepits), larger format outdoor products, and indoor products. The Leisure Season business model is a very stable one and offers plenty of room for growth through innovation.\nSales are rising on limited marketing.The company has started running PPC ads to expand their customer base, but they have traditionally not had to rely on a major marketing plan to attract new customers. Their reputation for high-quality products has done that work for them. They have sold products on Amazon without applying any marketing efforts, which gives the brand a major scale option by adding on traditional digital marketing plans such as social media marketing (they now post regularly on sites such as Facebook, Pinterest, and Instagram), enhanced SEO (they do have a blog on their website) and email marketing to get their products in front of customers.\nThe company has a smooth operation, with current ownership employing 3 full-time workers who handle daily tasks, processing 100+ orders per day during peak season. With the 3PLs in place, the company does not need a lot of employees to operate at high capacity.\nThe current owner is flexible and willing to remain with the right buyer after close, either through a transition or through a longer role, including communications with suppliers and new product development.\nOperating in a fast-growing niche space and with original products to offer, this company is in the perfect place to achieve quick growth and sharply increase sales.

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a DTC eCommerce Brand that is operating successfully in one of our most profitable industries, the Beauty/Personal Care Vertical. This company set out to make their mark in the Lip Balm & Skin Care niche and accomplished that goal by establishing their own proprietary set of lip balms that are drawing rave reviews from customers on Social Media — not only for how effectively they work but also for their amazing, unique packaging.\nAs the company notes on its Shopify Website, once a customer falls in love with their lip balm, it could become the last one they ever need to buy. But it’s even more appealing once it’s been delivered to their home in charming honey pot packaging. And a subscription option is available on the website to ensure continual recurring revenue for the customer base.\nThe honey pot is a significant symbol for this company. It was designed to complement the natural honey theme and flavor of their lip balm, and as part of that, the honey pot also symbolizes their commitment to the cause of preserving bees and highlighting their connection to the environment. This brand has been making monthly donations to the Planet Bee Foundation, and their SKUs help raise awareness of this environmental cause. This ESG Company and its “give back” culture is very important to the particular demographic buying their products.\nThat commitment to a social cause enabled this company to link its products to both personal care and the rising number of customers looking for eco-friendly products that promote sustainability, and for products made with an effective formula. This company checks both boxes, and that represents a major factor in their success.\nStudies today indicate that for the past 5 years, there has been a 71% rise in online searches for sustainable goods globally. Customers are now engaging with and buying from businesses that promote sustainability in ways they once ignored. Other studies show that 66% of all respondents and 75% of millennials say they consider sustainability when they make a purchase.\nThe brand is also boosted by the fact that lip balms remain one of our most evergreen products on the market, and sales have been increasing in the past few years, soaring past $793 million in global sales and projected to increase to $1 billion by 2023. Lip care products remain in very high demand, which is why this brand has enjoyed 22% month-over-month net margins and gross profits. Who wants chapped lips? Nobody.\nThe current owner decided to launch this business after repeatedly suffering from dry, chapped lips, and couldn’t find a product on the market that worked. So, they researched effective skincare ingredients and developed their own formulas, with their honey and strawberry-flavored lip balms becoming an audience favorite. Customers are providing the brand with highly enthusiastic reviews that compliment both the taste and quality of their SKUs.\nLaunched just under two years ago, the company has watched its revenues soar past $1 million, and their Repeat Customer Rate has already shot up by 10%. Customers are already urging the brand to add new flavors, giving the company one of the numerous enviable options for scaling quickly. Upsells now make up 5% of their sales, and that percentage is rising quickly.\nDepending on the buyer, lip balms are normally most popular during hot, humid summers or dry, cold winters, but their SKUs – at an Average Order Value of $28.38 — are already selling well year-round, with no seasonal factors.\nWhile there are a lot of lip balm products on the market, this brand has virtually no direct competitors offering one with their specialized ingredients or attractive packaging.\nSocial media has been a strong tool that the company is using quite effectively to expand their customer base. The brand posts daily on TikTok, where they have 51,000+ followers, and on Instagram, which gives them an additional 22,000+ followers. The company employs a VA who manages their collaborations with social media influencers, a tool bringing them a massive amount of new exposure.\nThey have the added benefit of possessing a huge amount of quality content ready to be posted on these sites.\nThe company also runs PPC ads on TikTok, Facebook, and Google to drive sales higher, and they’re getting the same positive results from their email marketing campaign to the massive database they have of 67K+ subscribers.\nA good scale opportunity for the company would be to launch an SEO program that takes full advantage of popular keywords to boost their ranking in search engines. A blog on their website focusing on both lip balms and on efforts to protect the bees would go a long way toward boosting their organic traffic even higher.\nThe company operates through a very efficient inventory model, keeping ample items in stock at their agent’s warehouse to fulfill the 350 to 1,000 daily orders. Since the items are small, the cost of shipping, storage, and packaging are lower, which helps drive a strong margin for the brand.\nThe current owners are spending between 20-25 hours each week running this business, focusing on tasks that include creating new PCC ads, media buying, and social media management. Several virtual assistants are on board to conduct customer support and influencer outreach.\nWithout a doubt, this brand has distinguished itself as being the only lip balm on the market with their highly unique, custom packaging, which helped them draw reviews from customers who say they’re encouraging their friends and family to buy their products. When you pull a lip balm out of your purse – people will be watching. Do you want a boring stick of ChapStick, or an amazing Honey Pot design?\nIncreasing their SKUs and shifting their listings onto new sales platforms such as Amazon, eBay, and Walmart would all contribute to a massive increase in sales, and the packaging design is giving the company a vibrant presence on viral videos posted to TikTok and Instagram.\nMost importantly, their customers are saying their balm heals their lips better than any other product.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a thriving eCommerce business offering the most extensive global wine rack range. While visually similar products are available, the company sells wine racks that are significantly superior to the competition and designed to last a lifetime. Customers have taken note, and the brand enjoys high levels of repeat business.\nThe company started in Australia and has grown to dominate the wine rack niche in that country. It sells through various B2B channels, including some major players. They then launched in New Zealand in 2021 and have grown continuously in the market. That same year, the brand opened in the United Kingdom and immediately saw impressive sales. So much so that they had to scale back to fulfill demand. Similar success occurred in the U.S., but orders were being shipped from Australia, and customers wanted quicker delivery. This offers enormous potential to dominate this market by setting up a 3PL in the country.\nThe business has operational 3PL facilities in New Zealand and the U.K. and is transitioning to a 3PL in Australia at the moment, which will remove significant rent as a cost.\nIn addition, the company is FSC certified. This certification is the highest form of timber sustainability available globally and took two years to acquire. They are the only wine rack provider globally with this certification. Something that many who are focused on ESG companies comes to respect.\nEach product is manufactured in China using 100% FSC Certified New Zealand timber. They are then shipped directly to the Australian, New Zealand, or U.K. 3PL facilities. The supplier produces products specifically for the brand, and exclusivity agreements are signed and in place. The business has full supply chain certifications and FOB pricing. They also have a few other smaller suppliers, domestically and internationally, for accessories.\nThe typical customer is split evenly between men and women. Most customers are from the medium to high-income demographic. Sales are consistent throughout the year, with peaks approaching Father’s Day and Christmas.\nEven as the business grows explosively, the owner works just five hours weekly. His primary tasks include:\n• Stock Forecasting and Ordering• Payroll• Reviewing Google and Facebook Ad Performance• Running The Instagram Account• Answering Staff Questions\nSome additional staff work for the business. These include a customer service agent, a full-time and part-time designer, whom both work as sales reps additionally, and two warehouse staff. The warehouse work is being transitioned to a 3PL, saving enormous overheads and resulting in a fully remote team.\nThe business is set up to be defendable. The main requirement for growth is the capital to purchase stock to satisfy the demand and the ability to set up 3PL operations in more locations. For example, sales were incredible in the U.S. when the market was tested, but the fulfillment time was 8-12 days, and feedback was that it needed to be 1-2 days. The company has not yet continued expansion there only because of the constraint of capital to purchase more stock.\nWith a strong working capital injection, further scale opportunities are abundant. A new owner has excellent opportunities on additional sales channels like Amazon for expansion. The company sells on Amazon Australia, which makes up only a fraction of its revenue. Therefore, it presents a huge area for growth and the possibility for a new owner to increase margins while driving new customers to the eCommerce giant.\nA new owner with Amazon expertise or a willingness to outsource the Amazon storefront to an experienced agency would likely see an enormous increase in sales on the platform. Importantly, this would present a more accessible opportunity to sell globally. Once established, the business can quickly sell into additional lucrative markets, such as Canada, the U.S., South Africa, Europe and parts of Asia where demand is rife.\nThere is also an immense opportunity to scale the operation with mass retail. The brand hasn’t ventured into wholesale outside of Australia, but the demand is evident. An aggressive campaign targeting major retailers and possibly hiring reps could create an enormous new revenue stream. This channel allows a buyer with an established sales network to grow income exponentially.\nTapping into digital advertising beyond SEO and AdWords is an obvious next step, and affiliate marketing and added focus to secondary sales channels can be implemented. This brand’s niche lends itself to influencer marketing on social media, particularly Instagram, Pinterest, and TikTok. They should look to influencers and collaborations to build more awareness and loyalty. Instagram already drives significant traffic to the Shopify website, and it’s worth considering implementing a highly focused social media campaign. In addition, paying more attention to email marketing has proven to boost sales and can be used to promote new products.\nThis company has such extraordinary growth potential at its fingertips. It can be scaled in several ways depending on the expertise of a new owner or the roadmap they decide on. It is a money-making machine waiting to take the world by storm.",

The key to their success has not only been to successful market to consumers interested in this unique vertical but delivering everything they sell through a membership-based market for both their digital content and thousands of products. The company’s phenomenal success can be measured in the fact that they’re now attracting1,000+ new subscribers per month, which is translating into 140% YoY revenue growth. It also helps that 95% of their products are sold under their own brand name, making them specialized and hard to find elsewhere.\nCustomers are getting something unique from this brand, which is why they’ve been able to grow so quickly. Their success can also be attributed to the rapid growth in the Wellness Industry, which has significantly matured in the past few years. The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted millions of Americans to rethink their attitudes and approach toward their health and wellness, including physical fitness and a desire to boost their immune system. Globally, the wellness market is now valued at $4.75 trillion, growing at a 10% rate.\nAnd their growth has not been driven just by individuals, but also by large corporations.  Corporate wellness has become a $66 billion industry on its own in 2022, with 75% of large employers and 33% of small companies running their own wellness programs, driven in part by increasing insurance costs. Operating in that kind of environment today has given this brand some healthy growth opportunities moving forward. They are now home to more than 5,400+ loyal subscribers.\nThe brand created Membership with a Mission.Messaging can be a cornerstone to success; this brand has demonstrated this concept by putting positivity at the top of their brand reputation. The company has focused on products designed to promote positive and uplifting attitudes, with that message imprinted on their apparel and jewelry. This has become a winning messaging campaign with their shoppers. Launched in 2019, the company created a unique model for their products, with a membership-only market featuring products and content built around the concepts of a Bohemian lifestyle and general wellness.\nWith subscriptions available for $13.95 per month, those who subscribe are introduced to an online marketplace where they can purchase a wide variety of items – the company has more than 2,000+ SKUs – that range from clothing and jewelry to essential oils, home décor, household products, and digital content built around themes such as meditation and yoga. Wholesale discounts are available to their members. Their membership now generates 80% of their revenue, while their products are bringing in solid revenues based on their Average Order Value of $15. Seasonality is not an issue as their products sell at a steady pace throughout the year. They now have an average Customer Lifetime Value of $75.\nTheir marketing expertly attracts new subscribers. The company has helped drive sales higher through PPC ads on Facebook, Instagram, and Google, which they use to run introductory membership offers and sales to promote their marketplace to newcomers. They follow up on these ads through SMS text messaging and email marketing campaigns, taking advantage of 30,000+ subscribers in their email database. The company sends out blog articles weekly to their email subscribers.\nStrong organic traffic is generated through their social media accounts, which include 168,000+ followers on Facebook and 17,700+ on Instagram. They post regularly on these accounts. They have also optimized their website for popular SEO keywords, and this has given the brand an impressive 27,000+ unique monthly visitors, which helps expand their customer base and drive sales higher. Their average customer today is between the age of 30 and 60, and 99% of sales are eCommerce, although the company has started to enjoy some wholesale customers as well. They now have 24 wholesale buyers and those numbers are increasing. On average, the company makes 30-50 shipments daily.\nOperations are very turnkey and easy to manage. The current owner spends just 20 hours per week operating this business, focusing on management of the site, launching new ads, developing new products and handling customer service issues. The owner employs a customer service manager and a virtual assistant who oversees daily operations. Their products are shipped from their 3PL, where they tend to stock thousands of their different SKUs. During the peak season, they maintain $20,000 worth of inventory, with new orders placed every one to two months.\nWith a strong understanding of fashion trends in their niche space, this brand has made a solid connection with people who are looking for uplifting products that enrich their lives. Many of them have found just that through this shop. Their membership acquisition strategies have delivered exceptional growth for this company, while the introduction of new wellness content is designed to keep new members on board and optimize their customer long-term value.

A PBN is a network of authoritative websites that are used to build backlinks for a single website. It’s a list of unrelated sites all linking to one central domain to pass link equity to it and improve its rankings. PBN Hosting is web hosting specifically designed to help SEO agencies safely and anonymously host a private blog network. By ensuring the domains in a link network cannot be tied together, one can safely link to a money site and enjoy higher rankings on Google.\nThe target platform is 100% custom-built and has no dependency on any 3rd parties. As a result, incredibly unique and powerful functionality has been added. The dashboard is connected to every website, unlike other PBN hosting providers, who simply return data from 3rd party providers in a custom display. From one simple screen, a user can install, remove or update plugins and/or perform a search and replace on one, some, or all websites they manage on the platform. The platform also has a similar link-management function where the user can manage links and anchors in bulk across all websites, making this a desired product for a wide number of users.\nMost PBN providers remove so many footprints that they are creating footprints themselves. The app uses AI logic to assign nameservers, CDN banks, DNS services, and modified SSLs to ensure 100% footprint-free hosting, which is necessary to avoid flagging by search engines. In addition, it includes built-in features such as WordPress Automated Posting to allow those with large networks to schedule their blog posts from inside the platform, for example.\nThe platform was designed to target large and small customers who need quick access to their blog networks and easy tracking of outbound links. Large SEO companies and link sellers love the platform, as do small businesses just starting up. The functions save their clients hundreds of hours of manual work and spreadsheets. So, it’s not only practical but also time-saving, which is a massive advantage this platform offers its clients.\nAnother key selling point is that the software has been built translation-ready. French, German, Italian, and Spanish languages, for example, would give the app a unique edge, unavailable anywhere else in the world, and it would almost certainly bring an entirely new customer base and revenue stream. As a result, market domination would be an opportunity to go after, and capturing 90% of the entire market is not an unreasonable projection.\nThe typical customer varies but includes people with a more significant number of websites, many B2B customers, and SEO agencies with networks used for their customers. Most customers are business-related, while the remainder is made up of private individuals building affiliate sites for secondary income.\nAnother service the business offers is domain sales. The site has a built-in live database from a prominent provider. They are given a 20% commission on every sale with no VAT liability. The system is fully automated and ready to flourish with some marketing.\nBacklink sales come from organic rankings, word of mouth, and existing customers of the hosting business. This has not been marketed in any way but could be. In fact, they just launched a new separate site for this included in the sale! But currently, 100% of sales are organic. Google AdWords is only used to protect the brand name to stop others from marketing against it. The company has only spent $1,000 on AdWords in two years. The tech stack for the hosting app is robust and custom-built in Django, a Python web framework.\nSite backups are also built into the platform to protect client data, fully automated malware scanning, and a hardened firewall tuned for WordPress. As a result, the hosting is tremendously fast and enjoys nearly 100% uptime. Additionally, the platform deploys all client sites inside docker containers to isolate each customer’s site sets.\nMany time-saving features and functions are built into the app, including SEO metrics, indexing checks, domain checkers, grouping features, and one-click restores. It’s a feature-packed app. This acts as a performance buffer with granular control and security for other users. Should one user’s sites be hacked or infected with malware, it is impossible to spill outside the containers and infect other users’ sites – which would generally be the case on shared hosting accounts. But with this company, they make it impossible without raising server costs. So, it’s a win for them and their users!\nOne excellent feature, for example, allows clients to create a blueprint of any site combination. The owner has designed a blueprint system that enables clients to generate any number of custom templates. These templates can include anything they need, like modified files, plugins, menu items, blog categories, banner positions, WordPress setting configurations, and a laundry list more. They can then select these templates to deploy instantly on newly added websites. This feature is precious, speeds up building new sites, and is unique in its niche.\nAs a unique selling point, this platform can be taken in so many different directions, in addition to the add-on revenue, it can generate. It’s perfect for all types of sectors. Not to mention that the business is highly profitable, with very low overheads. The company runs virtually on autopilot. All sold and associated services are quick and easy to do.\nWithout developing new features, this business can be run highly efficiently by one person, and it doesn’t take up more than five hours per week in its current format. So, scale opportunities are endless for a buyer with expertise in the niche.",

        "title": "SBA Pre-Qualified Business in the Writing Services Vertical – 65% Repeat Customer Rate – Strong Team of Writers in Place",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a nearly decade-old, SBA-Prequalified Business that provides a niche, and highly valuable, service for its client, including College and University students struggling with the weight of their workload. They employ a team of skilled writers to provide students with professional essays and PowerPoint presentations. These projects are tailor-made to their clients’ needs, and thanks to their qualified customer service representatives, they’re able to ensure that their customers walk away with everything they need to achieve a good grade.\nClients choose between 22 different Service Offerings with at an Average Order Value of $95. The company’s services cover a wide array of academic needs, including essays, research projects, and article reviews, which makes their services applicable to students of all majors. All that a client needs to do for the process is pay the fee, provide a description of what they need, and confirm the details of their project, allowing clients to focus on their other classes and outside responsibilities while the company takes care of the rest. The quality of the company’s services, along with their quick turnaround time of five days, has given them an exceptional Repeat Order Rate of 65%, and thousands of positive reviews. The average value of their top ten customers is over $7,500 showing the value of having such a dedicated customer base coming back time and time again for their services.\nThis company has been SBA Pre-Qualified by our lending partners, which translates to a low down payment and much higher ROI opportunity. A Qualified Buyer can purchase the business for as little as 10% down, depending on their own personal qualifications, which would then be amortized at reasonable interest rates over 10 years. This gives the buyer the opportunity to jumpstart their ownership and scale the business much faster than they would without a loan.\nThe company’s key demographic is college students between the ages of 18 to 55, with a heavy focus on clients who are balancing school alongside full-time jobs and other responsibilities. These students, many of whom are caregivers, members of the military, in nursing programs, or otherwise have overwhelming schedules that make it difficult to maintain grades without compromising health and lifestyle. Statistics show that 37% of college students fall within this bracket, and thanks to these stressors, less than 25% complete their degree within eight years. This business helps to make things a bit more manageable for these students and gives them a stronger chance of success.\nThe company’s marketing campaign revolves around organic traffic, with much of their growth having stemmed from word-of-mouth and satisfied customers returning to use their services throughout their college years. The company has also used social media channels like TikTok to gain more followers, which has historically led to upticks in the company’s consumer base. As such, improving upon their existing marketing campaign would be a fantastic way to scale the business, as itwould let the brand reach new clients and make them a more widely-known brand within this niche.\nSocial media is, of course, one of the best ways of scaling, however. In the times that the current owner has pushed social media channels like TikTok, the company has seen very strong sales spikes. They already have a Facebook account with over 14,000 followers, but by growing their following on these websites, along with other popular platforms such as Instagram and Twitter, they could see fantastic results.\nInternational expansion poses another great way for a new owner to grow the business. The company hasn’t explored global expansion, but other English-speaking countries such as Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom represent promising opportunities. Their social media accounts are already universally applicable, and given their strong team of writers, it would be simple to appeal to struggling students in these other regions. Another opportunity is in pre-writing essays, which would allow for faster delivery times, and place less strain on the writing team.\nThe current owner devotes a mere 10 hours per week to running the business, with their primary task being focused on marketing efforts. The rest of the workload is managed by an excellent team, consisting of a customer service manager, a customer service representative, and a writer manager, along with 10 to 15 writers who handle clients’ requests and projects. They also employ VAs, who take messages and respond accordingly to customers. The company is self-sustaining, allowing for an easier transition.",

        "title": "Amazon FBA Nutritional Supplements Brand – Strong Profit Growth Since Inception – 5 Years in Business – Over 100,000 Reviews on Amazon",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents an exceptionally high performer in the niche Health & Wellness Vertical of Human Dietary Vitamins & Supplements. This eCommerce company, operating mainly on Amazon.com today, has developed a large and loyal customer base for their products, which currently has over 100,000 4.5 Star Average Product Reviews just on Amazon alone. The products are designed to assist buyers in coping with daily health concerns, such as gut health, weight loss, hair growth, and skin care. All products are shipped via Amazon FBA.\nRecurring Revenue. Their success can be measured in both profit and the important metric of Recurring Sales, where this brand flourishes. 20% of Customers on Amazon are in their Subscribe & Save Program and 43% of customers on the Website are Repeat Customers. And these metrics do not include those customers that prefer not to be in an automated subscription program, but still, buy the products as soon as they run out. Traditionally with companies like this, repeat buyers make up a large portion of monthly revenue.\nThe brand enjoys a 5 Star Seller Rating on Amazon, with more than 8,000+ glowing reviews on the company from customers who offer first-hand accounts of how effectively their supplements work as intended and have helped to improve their lives. Those kinds of testimonials can be crucial for the success of any brand operating within the health care consumables field.\nChinese Connection. This company, which has its products manufactured for them in the U.S., is now on the verge of an exciting expansion into China, has signed a licensing and distribution agreement with a large, well-known Chinese Biotechnology company to sell their products on multiple online sales platforms in China, a nation with 1.4 billion people. Plans are in place to scale this dramatically given the enormous interest the Chinese Consumer has in buying US Made Nutritional Supplements.\nThe Supplements Market. The Chinese expansion is a major step forward in expanding the company’s growth potential, but as we will see, the brand has plenty of other strengths that go well beyond this licensing deal. It’s important to understand the significance of this niche market. In the US alone, the vitamin, mineral, and supplements market is valued at $33 Billion, with more than 3 out of every 4 consumers stating that they use these products. Of those customers, 61% report using supplements to support their overall health. Globally, the supplements market is projected to reach a phenomenal $300 Billion this year, as consumers become more aware of how these wellness products can help them live longer and more vibrant lives, combined with the ease of purchasing these products online without the need for a doctor’s prescription. The aforementioned relationship with China will be a big opportunity to grab that $300 Billion in market share.\nTo succeed in this lucrative but highly competitive field, companies must understand consumers’ evolving needs. Companies that keep up with the most important supplement trends have the ability to address consumers’ current concerns and build their loyalty. One of the keys to this brand’s success is that has been their focus from the start.\nThe Company extensively surveys its customers. Launched about 5 years ago, from the start this company wanted to know what kind of supplements customers were searching for and needing. Market research gave them a better understanding of the latest health trends, and what health concerns buyers wanted to address most. Surveys were conducted on consumers considered to be their “ideal” customers, asking them what their pain points were. That research led to a series of products that have grown to just under 40 SKUs, all sold under their brand name and made in the US in facilities that meet Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards and have been approved by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA). The company has been able to access certain ingredients that are typically limited to large sellers.\nThe result has been several top-selling products, including their Keto diet pills. This SKU has historically earned the brand a #1 Best Seller Badge on Amazon in the category of Keto Nutritional Supplements. Revenues are divided between multiple products so there is no single concentration of sales.\nCustomers have been highly responsive. Their Keto diet supplement has attracted a stunning 48,000+ reviews on Amazon, and this company has done exceptionally well using Amazon to find buyers. About 65% of their customers are women, and the brand appeals to customers of all ages, ranging from 18 to 65+, with the majority being aged 45 to 54. These buyers have come to the company seeking assistance with not just their general health, but also weight loss, skin care, digestive health, the aging process, and more.\nTheir sales remain strong throughout the year since people tend to take vitamins and supplements on a daily basis. While the company divides sales between its Amazon platform and Shopify website, most of their revenue (98%) comes from Amazon, where the company conveniently has all products shipped through Fulfillment By Amazon, and all SKUs are sold Prime for 1- or 2-Day Shipping. As noted above,  their Return Customer Rate is now 20% and rising on Amazon, and even higher at 43% on their own website, where their SKUS has a higher Average Order Value ($50.34, compared to $24.33 on Amazon).\nMarketing has given the brand key advantages. To reach these customers, the brand has a multi-faceted marketing plan. PPC ads are run on Amazon and Google to expand the customer base, while their team creates and schedules email marketing campaigns to their customers every week, promoting new products, and offering health tips and advice on dieting and workout regimes. They also create monthly newsletters. Content has been crucial to their success. Their team writes and publishes informative blogs on their website, which have been shared on various health websites, adding authenticity to their SKUs.\nThey have an active SEO program to improve their ranking in search engines, and a social media marketing campaign on sites that include Facebook (1,600+ followers), Instagram (1,400+ followers), and on Pinterest, where they average 15,000+ monthly views. They remain on top of the latest ranking strategies on Amazon.\nEmployees & Vendors. The current owners have 12 staff members whose titles include a director of operations, two graphic designers, a marketing director, two product managers, two customer service specialists, two business analysts, and two digital content strategists. This experienced team handles daily operations so the owners spend no more than 5 hours per week on this turnkey business. They maintain favorable terms with one of their main suppliers, who allows them to put 15% down rather than 50% when ordering. All labels and shipments go through rigorous FDA compliance standards.\nSummary. The company continues to source new products, with a gut health supplement and another offering anti-aging benefits now in development. Continuing to expand their product line, including into new categories, will enable this brand to grow rapidly, although they have plenty of other growth options, including scaling their China operations, expanding sales onto Amazon’s overseas platforms, and launching B2B sales. The company has already heard from retailers looking to distribute their products. This company has a healthy operation and an exceptionally bright future.",

        "title": "Scaling DTC eCommerce Brand offering Healthy Elixirs from Natural, Raw Products – 71% Repeat Order Rate – Massive YOY Sales Increase",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents an eCommerce Brand that operates in the online DTC space from its custom built website, selling custom, proprietary Elixir Formulations that promote health and wellbeing. This thriving brand manufactures and sells healthy elixirs made from natural raw products where Shikimic Acid is most prevalent, including White Pine Needles, Star Anise and Fennel Seeds. In the pharmaceutical industry, shikimic acid is used as a base material for the product of Tamiflu.\nThe product line is made exclusively by the brand for the brand, using organic extraction methods, and follow up testing for heavy metal content. The company sells through its Shopify-built website, with enormous expansion opportunities immediately available to sell on Amazon and additional secondary eCommerce platforms, given the excellent reviews and happy customers they receive on a regular basis.\nThe company’s 70% Repeat Customer Rate and $152 Average Order Value are testaments to the popularity and effectiveness of the products. With this kind of recurring revenue, the brand has proven that it is not only effective in the eyes of consumers, but something they need to continue to use going forward.\nThe Health & Wellness sector’s growth is explosive as more and more people realize the importance of healthy supplements in their diets. The industry has and will continue to be incredibly lucrative, which gives this company enormous growth opportunities moving forward, added to the fact that consumers are becoming far more health-conscious, prompted further by the coronavirus pandemic.\nRaw materials for the products are sourced from sustainable US suppliers, and the brand concentrates on elixirs that enhance quality of life and contribute toward clean living. The potent elixirs are extracted from the highest quality raw ingredients available. The white pine needles, for example, are hand-harvested from rural Massachusetts and, shortly after arriving at the company’s brewery, are put through an herb grinder into a fine powder before processing. The organic Chinese star anise and fennel seed are obtained from the same reliable source. The brewers follow strict procedures of ultrasonic extraction using organic vodka and filtered water.\nThe business has built a strong reputation, having grown tremendously quickly on the simple basis of customer satisfaction. The brand has truly created a unique product in a popular niche. It attracts thousands of visitors to its website every month. This business comes with an ideal catalog of SKUs, with no drastic concentration of sales on any given item. Many more SKUs can be added, although getting the current products loaded up on Amazon should probably be step one for a new owner.\nThis business’s core product offerings include elixirs of fennel seed, black cumin seed, star anise, organic dandelion, and colloidal immune support. Most customers come across the brand’s products via podcast, word of mouth, or suggestions from the owner. Customers then seek the company out on the marketplace.\nLogistics are first-rate, and management has fine-tuned operations. All products are made explicitly for the company with its formulas and designs, and everything is sold under the brand name. The company stocks 100% of its inventory and fulfills orders via USPS directly to customers. Roughly 50 shipments are sent daily.\nThe website, built on Shopify, is beautiful, clean, and full of well-shot product photos. As a result, it’s straightforward to navigate and incredibly user-friendly. In addition, the images clearly show the SKUs and their key benefits, making the USPs clear. There is immense opportunity for a new owner to scale the operation with mass retail. The brand hasn’t yet dipped its toes into the gargantuan wholesale market in this vertical; however, a focused campaign targeted toward health stores and possibly hiring reps could create an entirely new and colossal revenue stream. A buyer with an established sales network can take this company to new heights through this channel.\nTapping into digital advertising is an obvious next step, and affiliate marketing and additional sales channels can be implemented. For example, incorporating a blog with keyword research onto their Shopify-built website would help drive organic traffic to the site and enhance sales through internet searches.\nAffiliate and influencer marketing are obvious next steps given the high AOV. Additionally, the company can begin an email marketing campaign to its growing 13,000+ database while growing it and keeping existing and potential customers constantly aware of specials, new products, and the brand in general.\nInfluencer marketing has been a game-changer in the health food and supplement niche. Many businesses use influencer marketing to reach new audiences and drive online traffic and sales. Influencers are paid or given products to post a piece of content and express a particular opinion about a brand or product. Partnering with influencers relevant to the niche helps brands increase reach by getting in front of a new audience they may not have reached otherwise. For example, this companycan work with public figures aligned with the brand’s values to skyrocket sales of existing products and catapult new product launches.\nThis brand’s niche lends itself extraordinarily well to influencer marketing on social media, particularly Instagram and TikTok. They should look to influencers and collaborations to build more awareness and loyalty. Subscription boxes are also an excellent model in this industry, providing high margins, little follow-up marketing, and consistent cash flow. Recurring subscription options can produce and maintain repeat orders. New partnerships and additional SKUs could quickly add an entirely new customer base.\nThe company could easily use contractors for social media, Google advertising, and SEO work, with minimal effort and enormous ROI.\nExpansion opportunities are endless. Given the brand’s success in the USA, international expansion into lucrative markets, such as parts of Asia and South America, is a highly profitable prospect. This would undoubtedly drive revenue further as they begin to extend operations to customers where demand is rife.\nThe company is highly automated and requires minimal workload. The owner spends only 10 to 12 hours weekly on the business, focusing primarily on:\n• Managing product manufacturing• Fulfilling larger orders• Payroll• Marketing\nAdditionally, it has one customer service and fulfillment person and two brewers who manufacture and bottle products. Notably, the business has snowballed, and between the owner and three employees, they’ve managed comfortably as it’s scaled and continues to do so at a frenetic pace.\nThis business has unique products that consumers love and appreciate, prolific YOY growth, a loyal and happy customer base, and profit margins that any new owner would envy. In addition, no specialized systems or skills are needed to operate the business, making it ideal for a first-time operator to run while presenting enormous growth potential for an eCommerce or wholesale expert.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents an eCommerce brand that markets and is a leading supplier of custom granite, marble, and quartz countertops, tub decks, sinks, shower seats, fireplaces, wall cladding, exterior pavers, and more. With US headquarters inBoulder,Colorado, and production plants in Xiamen, China, the business has the unique ability to meet the design needs of any project on any budget anywhere in the nation. Customers all over the US have trusted this company as a preferred supplier, predominantly of quality stone countertops for multi-family and hospitality projects. The impressively high 20%+ year over year growth and average contract length of 18 months is a testament to this trust. Since 2008, they have completed hundreds of multifamily and hotel projects throughout the U.S. Their experienced team provides superior service with a focus on outstanding project management, timely deliveries, top-notch product quality, and unmatched attention to detail.\nThe business is a full-service operation that eliminates the headache of working with multiple providers to complete a project. They have become an industry leader by creating custom production documentation based on client specifications and seeing orders through to project completion.\nThe business operates well all year long. Although many competitors in this niche have inconsistent revenue, seasonality is not a factor for this company. The expanding demand and popular product line is a crucial reason for that. The furnishing and installation of quartz countertops make up 60% of sales, while other lines complement. Quartz is resistant to scratches and chips, and since it’s waterproof, it also resists stains and water damage. In fact, this is one of the biggest reasons people choose quartz countertops. Other prominent sellers include granite and marble. Granite offers excellent durability, heat resistance, and affordability, while marble’s popularity lies in its reputation as one of the most long-lasting types of countertops available. If a marble countertop is cared for properly, it can easily last a hundred years in the same condition it was first fabricated. The brand’s range is available in various hues and colors, suitable for many developers.\nFabrication & Shipping.After fabrication at the overseas plant, products are carefully packed in custom crates and loaded in containers for shipping to a U.S. port. Lead times vary from 70 to 90 days from the beginning of production to delivery at the job site. All shipments are handled by a veteran company in worldwide freight forwarding and are fully insured.\nWarehouse Storage & Flat Bed Truck Delivery.Once the shipments arrive in the U.S., the company ensures the crates are safely stored in their local warehouses or sent to the job sites via flatbed trucks for easy unloading.\nProfessional Installation.When the stone arrives at the site, an experienced team is contracted to handle the installation. Because the countertops are fully prefabricated overseas, installers can complete the job quickly and efficiently, surpassing customers’ expectations.\nThe company has enormous scalability by establishing relationships with additional general contractors and developers around the nation. The typical customer is a general contractor specializing in multi-family construction, and their employees often move from one company to another. This company’s goal in every job is to build strong relationships with project managers, who are customer representatives, so they always reach out for their next project. Furthermore, if they start working for a different company, they regularly still reach out and establish the brand with a new client. This company has achieved this goal, evidenced by an 85% repeat customer rate.\nThe owner has built an incredible team of full-time employees and contractors and primarily spends his time on communicating with the management team, current and potential customers, business administration, accountants payable and receivable and bookkeeping.\nSince the only advertising to date has been word of mouth, scalability from marketing is a highly profitable prospect. A few structured ad campaigns would likely show an enormous ROI, including: launching the company’s first PPC Ad campaign on Google, creating new social media and email marketing campaigns to boost organic traffic, establish an educational blog on the company’s website focusing on SEO, and launching a video marketing campaign with videos of top projects\nThis acquisition is ideal for a buyer with general knowledge of multi-family construction management, the ability to lead and expand an existing team, and an understanding of interior finish construction.

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents an eCommerce business in the Auto Parts & Tools vertical focused on the Performance Modification of Cars and Trucks. They have become a go-to marketplace for all things mod with an extensive customer base, strong cash flow, a solid reputation for world class customer service, fast shipping, and more than 170,000+ SKUs drop shipped from multiple suppliers directly to the customer. The drop ship nature of this business helps ensure that ownership is not buried in cash flow constraints associated with inventory purchasing, storage and pick/pack/ship overhead. Coupled with impeccable service and a stunning Amazon business, this brand is smoking the competition at every turn.\nOperating in evergreen and recession-resilient industries, this Internet Retailer keeps its edge by offering an array of auto parts that are in high demand amongst a car-dependent customer base. The company’s products, which include parts for brakes, exhaust systems, gauges, belts, and fluids, just to name a few, are wildly popular with do-it-yourself (DIY) customers. The global market for auto parts surpassed $390 billion in 2020 alone, driven by the desire among auto drivers to enhance their vehicle performance in terms of sound, speed, appearance, and safety. Environmental rules regulating noise emission levels as well as air pollution standards are also contributing to rising auto part sales across the country. Quite simply, many people love their cars and want to be certain they’re getting them the very best parts available.\nLaunched 4 years ago as an eCommerce website, this brand has expanded beyond their proprietary website and now generates 99% of sales via the Amazon platform. Tight relationships with multiple domestic suppliers and expertly negotiated, rock-bottom prices allow them to regularly win the Amazon Buy Box. All products are ordered through Amazon and are fulfilled directly by the supplier, which ships the items straight to the customer. This means the company holds zero inventory and pays no fulfillment or storage fees to Amazon. Their top selling product represents just 1.7% of total sales with no hero SKUs, leading to massive sales diversity and extremely low risk. With over 170,000 SKUs available and an average order value of $197, their sales remain consistent throughout the year. Their customer base spans across all age groups, races, and income levels – literally, anyone who drives a car and needs parts for it. The company typically sells over 125 parts per day. With no inventory to store and no warehouse needed to store it, working capital requirements are non-existent and overhead expenses are minimal.\nThis company could benefit tremendously from a digital marketing plan, something the company hasn’t utilized so far, relying instead on price point alone to drive sales. Considering their already impressive reach, scaling the business through a Business Facebook page, Instagram account, and even a DIY-catering blog could be tremendous. These marketing strategies can be effective in developing customer relationships and interactions, as well as powering up a stronger online presence for the business. The potential growth of the company is limitless, and  the organic traffic opportunities available through further outreach speak to that. The use of paid media could help grow sales on both the company’s Amazon platform and its website\nThis is a hands-off business for the Seller, with all customer service duties outsourced to VAs. There is also one General Manager that oversees all daily management activities. This is a simple business and an easy one to learn, especially for a buyer who has any eCommerce experience. All orders come in from Amazon to a centralized Sales Register via a connection with Zappier. Those orders are then sent for fulfillment to the supplier with the lowest price for the particular item.\nIt’s difficult to imagine a time when mass transportation reduces the number of autos on the roads, and until that’s the case, the demand for auto parts will remain high. This company has a massive customer base, strong sales trends, and has built a reputable name for itself. The new owner would have endless avenues to succeed, and unbridled capacity for company expansion— This company is firing on six cylinders and ready to accelerate into a new stage of growth.",

        "title": "Amazon FBA Personalized eCommerce Brand – Custom Fleece Blankets – 39% Profit Margins – Easy to Transition",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents an eCommerce business that provides Personalized & Themed Fleece Throw Blankets for special occasions such as birthdays, Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, and Christmas. The brand successfully combines two massively popular consumer trends: The desire for creative gift giving around special occasions and the increasing appeal of personalized gifts. The unique combination of thoughtfulness and creativity presented as an appealing, practical, and sustainable gift continues to open additional markets and create new demand.\nA broad range of opportunities is open to the brand: product expansion, new eCommerce marketplaces, wholesale market expansion, and harnessing social media and influencer marketing. Sites like Pinterest, TikTok, and Instagram are hugely influential in the gift and special occasions niche, and a strategic campaign would likely show excellent ROI. Introducing an affiliate program with influencer marketing and partnerships would make a great addition.\nThe highly profitable nature of this business has given this brand the cash flow it needs to move beyond specific occasions and focus on opportunities to develop additional products. As a result, it’ll enable them to continue DTC sales long after Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and Mother’s and Father’s Day has come and gone. In fact, the brand is now focusing on developing products in additional verticals that are not seasonal but are targeted toward other important occasions, such as funerals and anniversaries. With the ability to identify popular items, the owner can use these new SKUs to enable the company to shift sales away from a seasonal peak to year-round while continually growing the catalog.\nImpeccable service and great prices on quality items have given this business the power to become a leader in its niche. Rising sales have set this brand up to become a global company. Their reach extends through North America and Canada, but expansion opportunities are rife.\nAll products are designed by contractors, when necessary, while manufacturing is done by highly accredited suppliers with whom the business has built long-term partnerships. The brand owns two trademarks registered by the USPTO. Products are sourced from China and ordered directly from the supplier, after which they’re shipped to a 3PL warehouse in California. The company also has a sourcing agent in China who helps them order and store certain SKUs and arranges inspections of all products. The manufacturer usually agrees to keep some of the stock at their warehouse or the freight forwarders warehouse for 1-3 months for free or a small fee.\nThey maintain 93% inventory year-round because of the MOQ. However, the business could improve this number by finding a new supplier with a lower MOQ, negotiating the MOQ with the current supplier, or by increasing sales volumes, which is already happening. With an Average Order Value of $29, sales are soaring, and the company has 7 SKUs that have been best sellers and account for 68% of sales.\nThis brand has phenomenal growth potential as a company that has mastered the special occasion gift niche. Considering their great success with marketing products in the U.S and Canada, there’s ample opportunity to expand onto Amazon’s platforms in different regions like Europe, Mexico, Australia, and the U.K, amongst others. In addition, they could also continue to build sales momentum by expanding onto other local eCommerce websites such as Etsy, eBay, Walmart, and of course, their own website. Notably, all products are sold Prime, which comes with various benefits.\nThe owner spends just 10 hours weekly on the business, without the need for any additional staff. Instead, she spends her time managing inventory and PPC advertising. No office or warehouse space is necessary, meaning this business can be run remotely from anywhere in the world. A designer and a sourcing agent work on a freelance basis when needed. The minimal workload is a notable KPI, giving new owners a comfortable business to enjoy or plenty of time to focus on expansion.\nExpanding digital marketing strategies presents another excellent haul of opportunities. For example, a regular email newsletter would undoubtedly attract more customers, increase repeat business, and could be used to launch new products, run promotions, and offer upsells. In addition, implementing higher PPC ad spend on both Amazon and Google, starting an influencer campaign on their social media accounts, and getting top SKUs listed in popular, published gift guides would help this already flourishing business snowball. As it stands, the company only spends $10 per SKU daily, and by optimizing its listings and ad spend, sales would soar.\nThe typical customer is 16 – 65 years old. Some products appeal to the younger generation, like the best friend blankets, while others appeal to more senior buyers. Customers are looking for a gift for their loved ones and are willing to spend more on a good quality item, helping this brand achieve a customer lifetime value of around $25-$55. This is a terrific opportunity to take ownership of a company that is shifting from one that peaks highly during special occasions to one with the potential to become a top-performing gift site year-round. As new SKUs come online, this brand’s fantastic reputation with its loyal customer base and good word-of-mouth referrals will likely make it a leading contender as gift-giving champions.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents an eCommerce Brand that is thriving with the younger generation of Fashion Jewelry consumer, demonstrating a strong customer base and a skill at video marketing on the social media platform TikTok to expand their audience. The company is focused on Couples Jewelry (Couples Matching Jewelry) and has proven to be a leader in this niche, although it is an increasingly popular trend that has lower competition within the overall jewelry market.\nThe company hit the ground running early on in two ways: first, by selecting SKUs with direct appeal to couples, including rings, bracelet sets, love note necklaces, keychains, and candles; and second, through a marketing strategy that went directly to where their target customers were, and that was on TikTok. Do you remember Promise Rings – well those will likely never go away … and now there’s Couples Promise Rings … something to let everybody know that not just the girl is taken, butt the boy too!\nAfter testing multiple products, their eCommerce website was launched, and the company was able to use their TikTok videos to capitalize on the growing popularity of the couples’ matching jewelry niche. They have been riding the wave of popularity for this increasingly in-demand vertical ever since.\nThe fashion industry remains one of the most profitable in the world, with jewelry being one of the top items that people are purchasing online today. In 2021, the global jewelry market generated a phenomenal $228 billion, with projections that it will increase by an additional $21 billion by 2025.\nOnline jewelry shops are demonstrating enormous appeal as well, with online jewelry sales hitting $7.6 billion in 2021 in the U.S. alone in 2021.\nToday online jewelry purchases make up about 5-10% of all jewelry sales, and those numbers are only getting stronger.\nCouples matching jewelry has become a hot new trend in this field, and this brand was one of the first to recognize that and capitalize on it, giving them a head start in establishing their Shopify website as the go to shopping destination for appealing gifts for a loved one.\nThe company has the additional advantage of low competition in this niche space. Together with their high recurring revenues and smart marketing tactics, it should become abundantly clear to a buyer how attractive this offering is.\nThe brand capitalized on an emerging trend in jewelry. The concept behind this site was to capitalize on products where each couple gets a connecting piece, and videos of couples wearing and enjoying their matching jewelry proved to be the ideal way for the brand to connect with their target market, Zillennials and Gen X consumers. Through their creative use of TikTok — including PPC ads on the site — sales began to take off quickly.\nWithin months of being launched, the company had attracted 30,000 customers, and their first Q4 holiday season shattered their monthly revenue goals as their products become a hit gift item. Their typical customer is between 17 and 24 years old, very familiar with social media platforms and always on them.\nToday the company is enjoying a 37% profit margins. While couples tend to spend highly over the holidays, the company also enjoys peak sales during anniversaries and birthdays – meaning all year round.\nThey operate in a very broad niche, and among their 20something audience there are always newly engaged or married couples looking for a gift that is far more memorable and more meaningful to give.\nTheir success is built on impulse buying. The company now markets 11 SKUs with an Average Order Value of $28, with their custom magnet bracelet becoming their strongest seller, making up 60% of their holiday gift sales.\nA key to their success in driving sales has been to offer customers an inexpensive product on TikTok, usually priced around $20, which appealed strongly to impulse buyers and quickly drove profits higher. The use of this social media channel and their PPC ad spends have worked very effectively at driving traffic to their website, and the brand now gets up to 200,000+ visitors on their website, along with more than 50,000+ subscribers in their email database, which could be efficiently leveraged in the future for a newsletter that introduces new products and promotes upsells.\nThe company is planning to continue expanding their SKUs, with new products waiting to be tested on TikTok and other social media platforms.\nAnother obvious scale option for them would be to launch on more social channels, including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Pinterest. The company just relaunched its Facebook account, retargeting thousands of users to help connect with highly engaged users.\nThe company is also exploring the launching of an influencers campaign to help grow the lifetime value of their SKUs.\nThis business does not require long hours. Highly automated, the current ownership spends just a few hours each week running this company, with tasks that include conducting business research and developing new growth channels. They employ freelancers for certain tasks, and four virtual assistants to handle customer service.\nIn a healthy sign, the company is now shipping at least 600+ packages a day, which at peak times rises to more than 1,000 shipments. They typically stock up to 5,000 units at all times for their most popular SKUs.\nThe enduring, evergreen popularity of jewelry, loved by millions as an irresistible fashion statement, shows no signs of abating anytime soon, and in fact the biggest trend today appears to be the increased popularity of couples matching jewelry, which this company has taken full advantage of.This company has multiple impressive ways to scale quickly, and when it comes to their future, this brand looks like a real gem.\nContact Website Closers today so our brokers can outline how this jewel of a business is ready for some skyrocketing profitability.",

The business is every bit as chic and sleek as the mid-modern designs it sells. This business, which began as just two retail shops and grew into a large Internet Company, has blossomed into a successful eCommerce enterprise with glowing reviews from a rapidly expanding customer base— particularly millennials. This company has experienced skyrocketing success in less than 6 years as the modern furniture market has heated up. The thriving U.S. housing market has played a role in driving this because with the further development of new homes, there is a growing need to fill the home with furniture.\nThe company thrives on its Shopify Website as well as Online Marketplaces like Wayfair (where 65% of online sales generate from) as well as Overstock, Wayfair, and Home Depot. With more than 1,000 imported and stocked private label SKUs on offer and an impressively high Average Order Value of $1,000, sales have surpassed $22 million. The brand is well-positioned to expand, and current opportunities place them on track to pull in $100 million in sales.\nTheir products are in high demand.Since 2016, the company has been selling its brand of mid-century inspired modern furniture that includes living room, dining room, and bedroom furniture pieces. That includes products manufactured specifically for this brand, and others that are not. Living room items have become their top seller, making up 70% of gross revenue, with dining and bedroom sets bringing in the remaining 30%.\nTheir revenue has increased considerably as the brand’s product line expanded beyond 1,100 SKUs. Sales remain healthy through the year, with November serving as their strongest month thanks to Black Friday purchases.\nThe company has done particularly well appealing to young professionals who prefer smaller apartments, condominiums, or town houses near urban centers. Their compact furniture offerings just make sense in compact accommodations, and the growing trend toward smaller but more modernized luxury apartments holds promise for their future sale prospects.\nMultiple Sales Channels are a major strength.In the past few years, the brand has enjoyed a massive 77% YOY Revenue Growth as they continue to expand onto new sales platforms, most recently onto Home Depot, Walmart, and Target this year. They’ve reaped massive benefits by exposing their SKUs to the millions who use those sites. That enabled the company to expand sales well beyond their two brick and mortar stores inHouston.

On both their own website and on Wayfair, the company receives many 5-Star ratings from happy customers.\nAdvertising Utilizes Social Media to Boost Sales.Much of the brand’s effective marketing has been built around social media.

The company prides itself in maintaining a high level of client communication to ensure continued growth and success (not a set it and leave it approach).\nClients do not sign long-term contracts. However, after 3 months of service, the client becomes very sticky … with most staying on for years thereafter. The LTV and client retention rate of this agency is strong. The company has maintained $1 million in sales each year for the past decade and continues to hum along nicely; it could use some new blood in the form of a buyer to take this beyond where it is today. Today the company benefits well from word-of-mouth and glowing referrals – both of which help attract new customers.\nDigital marketing remains one of the most rapidly growing industries across the globe. The phenomenal shift of consumers doing shopping and searches on their laptops and smartphones has convinced the vast majority of businesses that they need a strong online presence that includes a contemporary content strategy targeting multiple devices. The global digital marketing market was valued at $340 billion in 2020 and has been growing at a rate of 12.8%.\nThe growing trends of remote working and online collaboration has shifted a lot of marketing campaigns to social media, search engines, blogs and PPC ad spends, creating significant advantages for digital marketing agencies with the kind of experience, industry knowledge and proven track record this agency has. Being able to document a clear picture of their Return on Investment (ROI) for clients can help ensure durability moving forward.\nThis agency focuses on driving traffic for clients. Launched in 2008, the agency offers a host of services that include Paid Search ads, Social Media ads, SEO and email marketing, which re-enforce messaging consistent with the client’s products and the customer needs. At the same time, they set up an account management team to directly connect with clients, maintain high levels of communication, and to provide quick answers and feedback at all times. Once a client is brought on, they are assigned to an account manager to facilitate their services. Clients have come to appreciate having direct contact with the person handling their account and maintaining intimate knowledge of the status of their marketing.\nTheir focus has also been on not just growing profits but scaling the client’s business in the weeks, months and years that follow.

Their growing client base has included plenty of eCommerce companies, regional service suppliers, software companies, and SaaS providers.\nTheir sales team works efficiently to attract new clients.

Most, however, have stayed with the company for years.\nThe company’s decision to put in place a system for strong referral relationships has also been a boost for the company. Their retention rate is much higher than at other agencies.

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents a budding eCommerce business that has found its niche within the Holistic Feminine Care and Hygiene fields. Its cost-effective, 100% all-natural products have won them the hearts and minds of women who know the importance of self-care and cleanliness, netting them a remarkable 42% Repeat Order Rate, several Celebrity Influencer Endorsements, and a large, enthusiastic customer base.\nThey have rolled out 51 SKUs, ranging from their widely popular personal feminine spa to stress-relieving teas and herbal soaps. These can be used to cleanse the user’s body, boost their natural processes, or even help them pamper themselves after a long, stressful day. The products rely on plant-based ingredients and come with instructions on how to start using them, making them an accessible and organic choice for any customer. The quality of these products has earned an Average Order Value of $54.72. Along with their rising number of repeat orders, the average customer is expected to increase in value by 44% over the span of 3 months.\nThe company is well-known for its message of female empowerment and camaraderie. They promote the importance of entrepreneurship, togetherness, and education about personal health and hygiene among women, and encourage discussion around subjects that are often considered to be taboo in some circles. In doing so, they’ve successfully built a community around their brand that embraces the idea of taking care of themselves, while advocating for other women to do the same.\nThe brand has kept this community going strong by actively engaging with them in multiple ways. On their official website, they’ve implemented a “results” and “comfort using the product” rating system to their reviews, which lets them keep track of customer feedback, and gives prospective customers some insight into what using the product will be like.\nThey have also developed solid presences on Instagram and Facebook, two of the most popular social media websites. On the former, they have more than 26,600 followers, and on the latter, they’ve reached 25,400+. Their social media pages regularly post memes and messages of self-love and empowerment, along with relatable jokes and commentary.\nTheir activity on these platforms, along with various marketing tactics and advertising campaigns, have led to an SMS contact list with nearly 79,600+ members, and an astonishing monthly average of more than 196,000+ visitors to their website.\nWhile their most popular sales channel is their website, which makes up 95% of sales, they have also set up storefronts on several well-known eCommerce websites, such as Amazon and Walmart. If they were to strengthen these storefronts and expand to other online retail platforms, they could quickly diversify their sales channels and scale accordingly. A stronger Amazon storefront would also make it easier to make the next step into a global expansion, as its various international websites are also widely used. International expansion, regardless of the channel used to achieve it, would massively expand their customer base. Along with optimization of their customer service, that would lead to exponential growth for the business.\nThe brand could also improve upon their existing paid media and marketing strategy to bring in more customers. They could partner with larger influencers in the wellness space, utilizing a commission of sales structure to benefit both parties. They could also branch out into podcasts and CTV, improve their email marketing campaign, and boost their SEO plan to spark more organic traffic and to keep their customer base buying regularly.\nThe best way for the company to grow, however, is by expanding their SKU roster to include other product lines that are involved with feminine hygiene. Potential product ideas include postpartum and menopausal care, along with menstrual products, so customers have an SKU to buy for whatever stage of life they’re in.\nThe company has a partnership with one of the largest manufacturers in the feminine hygiene space, and per their manufacturing agreement, the brand owns full rights to all products made for them. This keeps the manufacturer and possible competitors from copying and distributing the company’s products, letting them rest easy knowing any of their SKUs, current or future, will belong exclusively to them.\nThe business is incredibly hands-off for its ownership, as its daily responsibilities consist only of overseeing financials and signing off on initiatives. The rest of the company is managed by contractors, who handle marketing, customer service, and brand management. This makes the business a fantastic opportunity for a buyer looking for a light workload, or for flexibility in adjusting and molding it to suit their needs and lifestyle. They also have the advantage of thriving in a global market that is going strong and is projected to thrive in the upcoming years.\nIn 2020, the global market for feminine hygiene was valued at $37.20 billion USD and is expected to reach an impressively higher $54.52 billion USD in 2028 at a CAGR of 5.22%. The demand for feminine hygiene products is rising in part due to women becoming more educated on a global scale and having more opportunities to join the workforce. There are also efforts to destigmatize the subject of feminine hygiene and personal healthcare, which will lead to this company blossoming as more customers seek out its products. This acquisition is already on track for tremendous scale growth, but the right owner could propel it far beyond.\nIf you’re interested in taking advantage of this excellent opportunity, then contact Website Closers for more information from our brokers.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® presents an eCommerce business that has become an industry leading provider of indoor and outdoor furniture, with their products prominently displayed in specialty stores, department stores and home furnishing centers – both online and offline. For more than 20 years, retailers nationwide have been purchasing from this company, which provides exclusive wholesale private label products at a time when home furniture sales are soaring right along with the hot real estate market.\nFor the past 5 years, this brand has taken their catalog online, first with two Shopify websites and then two Amazon platforms. The result has been an impressive growth in the company’s DTC sales and a rising Repeat Customer Rate. The company’s shift into eCommerce has been a huge success for them, increasing their profitability and brand awareness nicely.\nThe company’s reputation for exceptional value matched with affordable pricing and first-rate customer service has only strengthened since they expanded into eCommerce, and this enterprise is also benefitting from the current state of the highly profitable home furniture industry.\nChina Team. The company is hitting numerous daily record sales events with no signs of a slowdown, and a lot of this is attributable to their team in China. Their products are designed and manufactured for them in China, where they have a team of 30 people (in addition to their 20 US staff members) that handle sourcing, merchandising, QA/QT, shipping and accounting for the company. This China team is highly valuable not just for this business, but also for future product lines. Everything is sold under the company’s brand name, and they have a strong reputation for high quality products, affordable pricing, and excellent customer service – all of which is highly attributable to their cross-border capabilities in Asian, which very few furniture companies have at their disposal.\nWith the real estate market continuing to break records and homes getting purchased within days of landing on the market, that has resulted in increased spending on home renovations and home furnishings. The home furnishings industry hit $120 billion in 2021 and is projected to keep growing by 4%.\nThere has also been a heightened interest in making outdoor home areas look as comfortable and appealing as possible. The outdoor furniture market in North America is projected to reach $6.7 billion by 2027, and manufacturers have responded by looking for creative ways to produce new outdoor furniture, allowing customers to choose from a wide range of wooden, plastic and metal finishes and colors.\nThe end result for companies such as this one has been a sharp increase in sales for items designed to make outdoor living space more attractive. One of this brand’s greatest strengths has been the diversity of their catalog: they now have more than 2,000 products available. That gives this brand a major scale option, as we will see while reviewing the company’s track record within this very lucrative niche space.\nGrowth Partner. Due to the massive near-term growth the company is experiencing, this company is being valued based on a discounted cashflow model. Ownership is interested in retained equity and remaining involved; the perfect buyer would be one that welcomes the Founder as a partner after closing, who has access to capital, connections and a network, and who can be highly influential in taking this business to $100M in Revenue, and beyond. The structure of the deal will be important, but the seller is open and flexible, especially if the right buyer comes along with the tools necessary to help grow this business.\neCommerce was a major decision for the company. From the start, all the company’s products have been designed and manufactured for them, to be sold under their brand name. Initially marketing these products to traditional retailers, the company’s product line continued to expand, and now includes a diverse and stylish selection of Adirondack chairs, outdoor patio sets, patio umbrellas, outdoor patio heaters, indoor dining room sets, and bar stools. In total, their catalog includes more than 2,600+ SKUs. The success of their wholesale program enabled the company to sell directly to customers through their two Shopify sites and on Amazon. With an Average Order Value of $200, the company is doing exceptionally well, shipping 360 orders a day to a customer base that includes literally anyone who owns or rents a home.\nPatio furniture has become the company’s top seller, representing 80% of the sales. While their products bring in solid revenues year-round, sales peak in the spring and summer. Today in addition to their branded products, they also sell third party SKUs on Amazon.\nThe company is growing its eCommerce sites. To boost their eCommerce sales, the company has used different digital marketing tactics to drive sales. They have been running PPC ads on Google and social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram to attract new customers, while they also run PPC ads on Amazon.\nThe company has an SEO program to ensure their websites rank well in search engines, and they also have an educational blog to attract new customers.\nThe company is starting to see an increase not just from new buyers, but also on upsells. Their Repeat Customer Rate has started rising to 10% and continues to get higher. The company also maintains plenty of 5 Star reviews on their Amazon platform from customers who have raved about the high quality of their products, fast delivery, and excellent customer service.\nThe company ships products from its 50,000 square foot warehouse, while new inventory orders are placed once a month to keep up with customer demand. For wholesale accounts, the company offers its customers both dropship and direct shipping opportunities for their extensive line of outdoor patio furniture.\nIt’s important to note that they are now offering just 10% of the items available in their furniture catalog, so there is a massive growth opportunity here by reviewing the remaining 90% of the catalog and adding many of those SKUs to their existing sales channels. A partner that acquires this company should have access to capital to capitalize on the low hanging fruit available in SKU expansion. A buyer of this company could expect massive growth from that kind of investment in future inventory.\nThe company has an experienced team in place. The current ownership employs 50 workers, which includes 20 in the United States, such as those working as account managers, customer service representatives, a production team, an office manager and a warehouse manager. In addition, they have 30 workers employed overseas, handling sourcing, merchandizing, shipping and more. Some contractors have been added to handle aspects of the company’s marketing efforts. As a large B2B and DTC operation, this team has the experience and skill to manage all daily operations for a buyer.\nCustomers have come to love this brand’s attractive and carefully made furniture items, and the company has clearly fulfilled its mission to offer premium products at a time when the demand for outdoor furniture is skyrocketing. With a thriving eCommerce customer base and a strong B2B/wholesale market, this company is ideally positioned for a huge amount of growth in the near future.\nContact Website Closers today to find out more about this amazing Middle Market Transaction.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a business operating four successful eCommerce brands, each one thriving with a strong customer base for their unique niche appeal in multiple product verticals.\nThis gives a buyer a unique opportunity to not only enjoy recurring revenues from 4 profitable sites, but to have multiple opportunities for both near and far term scale. These sites are doing exceptionally well in just 3 years of operations and have equally impressive growth potential. Since all their products are proprietary and based on their own designs, a buyer has the added advantage of marketing SKUs that can’t be found elsewhere – and that have drawn glowing reviews from satisfied customers.\neCommerce has completed changed the field of retail, while also radically changing the concept of what it means to start a business. Today, more than 63% of shopping journeys start online, significantly enhancing the appeal of starting an eCommerce site on a platform such as Shopify, which has more than 1 million merchants selling there.\nMarketing proprietary products can give a seller a clear advantage over those reselling more common items, and this can be especially profitable if the company has a smart marketing strategy that produces high organic traffic and a strong connection with their customer base.\nThe company carefully researched its products. The websites market popular items such as socks, t-shirts and jewelry, but with a difference: all products are from their own specialized designs, created by their design team and sold under their brand name with custom packaging. If customers want their specific products, these four sites are the only way to find them. Their products were not chosen randomly. Their niche spaces were chosen after researching and launching test brands in 15 different categories, until they found four spaces with the most active buyer groups available. In effect, the company knew exactly what their audience wanted before they even launched.\nSales have remained strong, and the number of SKUs they offer has skyrocketed, giving their customers more options and the brand more opportunities for upsells and continued expansion of their customer base. Their site devoted to themed designer socks now has 114 SKUs, and their print on demand apparel has 234 parent SKUs and, with the ability to offer different colors, themes, sizes and t-shirt styles, more than 10,400+ products altogether. All products are customized and manufactured entirely for this brand. The company continues to expand, and in 2022, their focus is on international sales and taking their products to a global audience.\nThis is a smooth, seamless operation. How challenging is it to manage separate websites? When the sites are expertly set up to be highly automated, not much of a time commitment at all. The current owners now work no more than 15 hours per week managing all 4 sites, with their primary tasks focused on product development and marketing. 90% of the daily workload is handled by an experienced team of virtual assistants who manage customer service, social media, and supply chain issues. Once their products are sourced from their suppliers, orders are drop shipped by the suppliers. All fulfillment is managed by their third-party suppliers. For their designer socks, they maintain up to 3,000 items in inventory to keep up with demand, although they obviously do not stock any print on demand products.\nTheir Average Order Value ranges from $31 on their designer socks to $51 on their print on demand items, and the products face no seasonality limits. In fact, these products were specifically chosen to balance out one another’s seasonal appeal so sales would remain strong year-round.\nA marketing strategy is in place. With multiple eCommerce sites, this brand has relied on a multifaceted approach to marketing and advertising their 4 websites. The parent company has an email database of nearly 200,000 subscribers across the brands, and they have effectively used email marketing to connect with their customers.\nThat and their text messaging – which include informational newsletters to customers – has given the brand a 16% Repeat Customer Rate, and those figures are rising. The brand also shares content about new products on their social media accounts, including Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest.\nTheir SEO program works to boost organic traffic to all four sites through use of keywords strategically placed throughout each site. This program is working, since their designer socks site has 81,000+ unique monthly visitors, while their print on demand sites averages between 51,000+ and 70,000+ monthly visits.\nOne of the biggest options for growth is to expand sales onto popular sites such as Amazon, Etsy, Walmart, and eBay, which offer major scale opportunities for each of their products.\nThis company is a highly successful operation with numerous key Value Propositions. They have a massive variety to sell, offering thousands of unique products, which have received glowing praise from their customers for using high-quality materials. Their pricing is highly competitive, and their fast shipping guarantees strong and reliable customer service.\nIn addition, their unique designs remain one of their most significant value propositions. This is a brand that has designed its own reliably strong future, complete with excellent scale opportunities across four sites.

        "title": "Amazon eCommerce Retailer – Sells its Own Brand of Goods as well as the Brands of others – Strong YOY Sales on High AOV Products",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents an eCommerce company that is thriving on its Amazon storefront, marketing both its own branded products as well as other popular brands’ products. A key to their skyrocketing sales has been the ability to carefully select products they know are top sellers and in high demand. It’s impossible to downplay the significance of that, how it has contributed to this brand’s success and profitability, and how that makes this acquisition a highly desirable one for a buyer to consider.\nHighly effective product selection is a hallmark of this company’s ongoing success, and more than a decade of experience has enabled this enterprise to fine tune that into a near-science. The company knows how to successfully launch strategies that they have developed over time.\nConsidering that this brand now markets 25 popular SKUs, their ability to grow rapidly, doubling or tripling profits in record time simply by expanding their product line, shouldn’t be underestimated.\nAmazon has created a remarkable marketplace, not just for consumers but for sellers as well. The advantages provided to entrepreneurs looking to start an online business are plentiful. Amazon remains the biggest eCommerce retail platform, and has recorded stunning growth in net revenue, from $135 billion in 2016 to a market value of $1.49 trillion in 2020.\nIn that year, Amazon ranked as the top U.S. company in retail eCommerce sales, taking in 38.7% of the market. Studies show 63% of consumers start their search for a new product on Amazon.\nFor sellers, the competition can be fierce: there are an estimated 9.6 million sellers on Amazon. That’s why choosing a product to sell on Amazon is one of the most important decisions any seller will make.\nThe right decisions can be highly profitable, as this brand has discovered, bringing in a phenomenal $9.3 million in gross revenue. A review of how they got to this enviable position will demonstrate for a buyer what a worthwhile investment this company truly is.\nThis brand was launched 12 years ago, offering both their own brand name items and many resells. The company has a website that highlights their own brand SKUs, including popular drones and drone gear. The company operates globally, while recognizing that the public’s interests and shopping habits are constantly shifting, so they need to keep up with the latest trends and advances in technology to remain competitive.\nThat’s why they set out to select only high value items that translate into high profits. With 25 SKUs available, the brand has a high Average Order Value of $615 that keeps profits high. Their unique mix of products has sales humming throughout the year, with no seasonal factors, although their electric coolers bring in predictably strong sales during the summer months.\nTheir products appeal to a unique customer mix, including adventurers and hobbyists, and their products are readily available on not just Amazon but more recently Walmart as well.\nIn addition to being highly profitable, this operation is a very smooth and efficiently managed one. The company stocks its products, using Fulfillment By Amazon for half of all shipments. They now ship by to 40 items daily from their 3PL warehouse, while maintaining on average $500,000+ in inventory at all times to keep up with customer demand.\nA buyer would not find this business requires a heavy workload. The current owner spends just 20 hours per week operating it, with a focus on handling customer service, purchasing inventory and listing products on Amazon. The owner does not need any employees because this business is so highly automated.\nThat demonstrates another key advantage to operating on Amazon. The company’s marketing campaign has largely consisted of running PPC ads on Amazon, which has helped expose their products to an increasingly larger audience, expanded their customer base and boosted sales.\nThe company uses Seller Central, and all of their Amazon SKUs are sold Prime. Essentially, the brand is using Amazon to achieve what virtually all online sellers want: a minimal workload, and healthy profits.\nThere are certainly ways to boost this company’s profitability even higher. This company continues to explore new product development to discover items that buyers are certain to find appealing; their most recent product in development is a window bird feeder that the brand is ready to start testing.\nThe company could also expand exponentially through a more aggressive digital marketing strategy. Launching a social media marketing and email marketing campaign would be ideal for not only boosting organic traffic and attracting more customers, but for upsells to their existing customer base.\nThe same is true for an SEO program that uses keywords in product descriptions to give them higher rankings in search engines and a blog on their website to attract more visitor traffic.\nThis company is a virtual roadmap for how to successfully use Amazon to create a thriving eCommerce platform. As part of the acquisition, the current owner is ready to review with a buyer their proven method for selecting high quality SKUs that are guaranteed to sell and bring in a high profit.\nThis offering is one that gives a buyer all the strengths they’re looking for in a business, from popular products to high recurring revenues, to an expanding customer base and great scale potential.

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a rising eCommerce business based within the Smart Home Technology Vertical. This company does an excellent job of filling the niche space of Smart Lighting and Smart Plug Subcategories with their wi-fi connected, APP-controlled lighting products. They offer an impressive 30 unique SKUs, and with their 14 patents, they have successfully created a CPG moat that protects their products from the competition. Everything they sell is branded and well packaged under their name. They’ve found massive success on Amazon, as not only do they have a 99% Positive Seller Rating, but they also happen to be rated the Amazon #1 Best Seller (as of the date of this listing) in the Smart Dimmer category as well. With more than 300,000+ users of their mobile app, this company is large and growing fast. In the hands of the right buyer, this could develop into a common, household name. But with 300,000 App Users – maybe it already is?\nThe brand has developed a strikingly large following thanks to the variety of IoT smart products they offer, in a market that sees less competition thanks to their investments in IP. Their products include, but are not limited to, dimmer plugs and switches, color bulbs, and ceiling fan control. All these offerings can be controlled with Google Home and Alexa, giving customers the convenience of changing how bright or lively their home is from the comfort of their couch. The brand has cultivated hundreds, if not thousands, of positive reviews on their products, along with a truly remarkable Repeat Customer Rate of 28.4%.\nThe global market for smart homes and related technology is enormously profitable and seeing increasingly stronger demand with time. It was valued at $79 billion USD in 2020 alone and is projected to reach an astounding $313.95 billion USD by 2026 at a CAGR of 25.3%. For many real estate and home construction businesses, it’s become standard to offer the latest and greatest innovations in home automation in an effort to bring in a customer base that has developed a strong interest in smart technology and conveniences. As technology is polished further to offer even more monitoring solutions and automation functions to the average consumer, this interest among the general population will continue to see exponential growth.\nThough the company has its own website, currently all its sales are performed through their Amazon storefronts. They also utilize many other benefits to the Amazon platform, such as Fulfillment by Amazon for their deliveries, and PPC advertisements across the site. Given their massive success and connections with Amazon, it would be a natural next step for the company to expand into international channels such as Amazon Europe to market their products to a global audience.\nThe company could expand outside of the Amazon network and into other secondary online markets, such as Walmart and Target. While many customers rely on Amazon for most of their online shopping, this would guarantee that the products would reach as wide of a consumer base as possible.\nThe company could go even further by launching wholesale and B2B sales with major retailers and big box stores. Combined with their other means of expansion, that could drastically increase profit margins.\nAnother way that the brand could grow would be by improving upon their existing advertising. Though they see no shortage of customers through current marketing tactics, they could increase their promotions and PPC advertisements on Amazon, and even invest in ads on other platforms such as Google and Facebook.\nThey could utilize the contacts among their 300,000+ strong app users for feedback on future features and new products, which would allow them to develop a stronger connection with their audience, and also serve as excellent marketing for upcoming product lines.\nThey could even use social media platforms such as Instagram, Pinterest, and Facebook to drive organic traffic, and develop a more loyal and dedicated consumer base.\nSocial media would also have the benefit of making it much easier to do marketing campaigns and share any special deals or new products that the brand rolls out, increasing their popularity and boosting their reputation.\nThe company would also profit by releasing new products to offer consumers. While they already have 8 new SKUs that they plan to roll out soon, they could benefit by adding more onto their product line. For instance, they could expand into other valuable Wi-Fi connected home devices, such as smart locks, sensors, and other products that might appeal to their tech-savvy consumer base.\nAnother benefit to this fantastic acquisition is that it already has a strong and capable staff line-up. It boasts 10 full-time employees who focus on sales, customer service, graphic design, and supply chain management for the company. The current ownership handles finance, product planning, marketing, and a few other responsibilities, but a buyer could lighten the workload by hiring on more staff dedicated to these tasks.\nThe company has also cultivated some rather enviable customer demographics. Though their products are enjoyed by all age groups, they have seen great popularity among customers in the 35 to 44 year and 45-to-54-year age range, with the two groups making up roughly 26% and 22% of the company’s customer base. This isn’t particularly surprising, since these two age groups are the prime home-owner demographics.\nThey also span across income levels, targeting customers with salaries of around $50,000 to those earning well over $250,000 USD. The gender of the customer is irrelevant to sales as well, showcasing that this brand is beloved by a wide variety of consumers.\nWith progressively more people choosing to work from home instead of heading into the office, it stands to reason that they would want to make their homes a more convenient environment. Orders for smart home devices are set to double now through 2023, and surveys show that more than 65% of homeowners are willing to spend more on smart home technologies. This brand has an edge over the competition given that, due to its patents, most other companies in the smart home business operate mostly within an offline channel. Online shopping and eCommerce is also highly valued for its convenience, which overlaps nicely with a consumer base that prioritizes convenience and automation.\nThe smart home market is set to experience rapid and exponential growth very soon, and this acquisition gives buyers the chance to capitalize on it and build this company alongside these rising trends.

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a unique opportunity to acquire a strong footing in the enormously profitable jewelry industry by taking ownership of an eCommerce Brand that provides its customers with a stunning array of individually branded, customized jewelry pieces. Since purchasing this 14-year-old business from its founder in 2019, the company has undergone an impressive expansion, creating five new, unique, and individually branded jewelry collections, adding more than 30 new jewelry pieces. This Sterling Silver stunner continues to scale on its Amazon platform, where sales are thriving.\nWith more than 300 SKUs and 60 additional products now in development, the brand’s opportunities to scale are strikingly obvious, especially since the team has everything they need to grow, from a team of designers and assemblers to strong supply relationships. Adding a substantial volume of SKUs while putting a major emphasis on customer service have played a major role in the company’s development, as has developing attractive and eye-catching packaging that is important in the gifting category.\nMoving forward, this brand’s assets keep growing as the enterprise has established a profitable niche position in this field, which remains one of the most financially booming industries across the globe, with sales projected to reach a remarkable $480 billion by 2025. A review of their top assets helps paint a clearer picture of this brand’s immense strengths.\nThe brand follows a key trend in the jewelry industry.As one of the most ancient and enduring forms of personal expression, jewelry remains phenomenally profitable and historically recession proof, but it’s also a field that continues to adapt to changes that reflect shifting public tastes and interests. One of the clearest trends has been toward diversification, which has been a major contributor to this brand’s growth.\nThis company has more than a decade of experience in creating gifted jewelry items targeted to events and holidays throughout the year. That includes Sterling Silver and gold-filled pieces presented on a card inside the jewelry box with a sentimental and meaningful message. Customers love it. This has given the brand an exceptionally positive response from customers who feel they’re getting far more than they would by buying from a competitor, which adds enormous value to their purchase.\nWith most of their products ranging in price from $35 to $45, customers can quickly recognize the massive value they’re getting on their purchase.\nThe brand thrives on AmazonSince the company was purchased in 2019 and began their product expansion campaign, sales have risen from $3 million in 2018 to $8.6 million in 2021, limited almost entirely to Amazon, leaving all other avenues still open for targeting growth.\nFormed initially to specialize in niche gift items that create an emotional connection between the buyer and the person receiving the gift, their Sterling Silver necklaces, bracelets and charms have appealed to an increasingly wide audience. Their primary focus has centered on  items that cater to special dates such as Easter, graduation ceremonies, Valentine’s Day, and Mother’s Day. Sales grew steadily when the brand pivoted from its original Shopify site to Amazon.  The owners have since optimized every aspect of the Amazon platform, inventory management and product assembly but lack the marketing and ecommerce backgrounds to tackle selling on social media, through affiliates, B2B, etc.  A team with this experience could drive growth to record levels.\nToday, the brand enjoys a 100% positive Lifetime Seller Rating on Amazon, a stunning accomplishment, and Amazon now makes up 96% of sales, with an additional 2% from their website and a rising percentage on Etsy.\nAdvertising is done for them.Among their 300+ SKUs, the brand has 50 best sellers, and with such a high Seller Rating, the company benefits phenomenally from word-of-mouth advertising. Customers who have helped give the brand a 5.0 Seller Rating on Amazon refer plenty of friends, family members, and coworkers to their site, driving up sales exponentially among these circles.\nWhile the company has been able to shine on Amazon through PPC, and word of mouth referrals, there is no question that a more aggressive and comprehensive marketing campaign holds out massive potential for this company to send sales skyrocketing,\nThis brand’s years of experience give them impressive strengths that include wide name recognition, a highly profitable platform on Amazon, a stunningly high degree of customer satisfaction, and the ability to creatively design new products that become irresistible to their existing customer base. Those customers are only too happy to help spread the word about how good their products are.\nNow enjoying sky-high revenues on products their customers love, the company instantly delivers to a buyer their high recurring revenues, and a talented and experienced team in place that understands what their customers want and how to keep that base coming back for more.\nIf you want a clearer picture of how profitable it would be to enter the field of jewelry, contact Website Closers today for a more detailed look at the phenomenal opportunity available here.",

        "detail_description": "Website Closers® is pleased to offer a dominant, ethical, and trusted force in the sector of online self-help and advice, specializing in the industry of Psychic Readings. This is an extremely rare opportunity to acquire a “turn-key”, highly profitable, 24/7, 365 day per year income generating, “gig economy” format business, with zero working capital requirements.\nThe Buyer will acquire a powerful, advanced, state of the art telecommunication platform that has provided emotional support, comfort, and direction for over a million clients within the past 10 years of operation.\nNOTE:It is important to understand that the Company does not provide Psychic Readings. The site is a technology platform designed to connect consumers of psychic readings to the providers of that service.\nClients of the website can select from four ways to communicate with their Psychic Advisor:\n● Phone● Chat● Message● Text\nThe Company’s clients most commonly seek the guidance of a psychic advisor regarding questions of love and relationships. However, any question or topic may be asked during their psychic reading. Other common topics include, but are not limited to: Career, Financial, Family, Destiny, and Mediumship. Payments for services are made in advance by clients preloading their online account via credit card.\nThe evergreen aspect and longevity of a company such as this cannot be disputed. Psychic readings have dated back to ancient times, originally founded in astrology. Seers, prophets, and clairvoyants served a functionary role in early civilization. The role of these individuals clearly continues today, and will forever appeal to a solid segment of society that seeks reassurance and spiritual guidance from Psychic Advisors. This can be no more clearly demonstrated than by the year over year results of the Company.\nCurrently, the Company has approximately 250, independent contractor classified Psychic Advisors. All Psychic Advisors are considered independent contractors by federal employment laws, as they are categorized as entertainers. Psychic advisors are paid a percentage of services sold. This provides for margins (before operation costs of) 73% – 78%.\nThe Company is a highly automated and advanced application requiring only four full time remote employees to operate (including live customer service). Employees cover the day-to-day tasks such as:\n● Member Care (live customer service)● Screening of psychic applicants● Social media management● Payroll and fraud prevention\nThe company receives about 125 inbound customer calls per day, all of which are managed by the four full time remote employees.\nAll members of the organization, from corporate management, to employees, to independent contractors (Psychic Advisors), and all technical support team members work remotely with no required centralized location. The business is 100% service-based with no debt, no payables, and no working capital requirements. The company comes complete with four, dedicated, full time employees that are 100% remote. This allows the company to operate 100% virtual and transferable to any buyer anywhere in the world.\nThe employees consist of a General Manager to oversee the day-to-day operations, a payroll and risk management coordinator, and two other team members to oversee contractor onboarding, customer service, and quality control.\nThough the company provides services 24/7 and 365 days a year, executive oversight is minimal. The executives primarily oversee website maintenance, marketing concepts, employee payroll, and address any issues elevated by the General Manager.\nThe online platform recently completed a ground up website redesign and new mobile app. The massive 3+ year development upgrade allows the new owner to enjoy a fully upgraded, automated system, ready for the future of online psychic readings. The Company re-investment of over $200,000 includes a completely modernized, state of the art 5X portal technology.\n● 1X: Website Member Portal● 2X: IOS and Android App Member Portal● 3X: Employee Admin Portal● 4X: Psychic Advisor Admin Portal● 5X: Developer Admin Portal\nIn addition, the Company also offers:\n● Horoscopes via SMS – A free service and remarketing strategy of the Company is daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly horoscopes. In addition, users can subscribe to have their personal horoscope texted to them each day.● Zodiac Love Compatibility Tool – A free service and remarketing strategy of the Company is their Zodiac Love Compatibility Tool. Here users can select the sign of themselves and their partner and connect to 144 articles of advice.● Psychic Blogs – A free service and remarketing strategy of the Company is their Psychic Blog, containing 100’s of self-help and inspirational articles.\nCurrently, the business serves the US and Canadian markets, but expansion to other counties/markets can be quickly scaled. In addition, other scale opportunities are defined as multiple, high value, provided URLs where the existing telecommunication platform could be duplicated and rebranded for additional psychic guidance websites, to quickly increase market share.\nAlternatively, the platform could also be used to launch similar “advice based” online services. For example: An expansion site could host an “expert” in any field, where the user could seek consultation: lawyers, doctors, veterinarians, mechanics, electronic technicians, computer technicians, tax accountants, plumbers, electricians, and more.\nAfter ten years of development, marketing, and steady reinvestment, the executives are ready to offer their company to new owners and transition to enjoy the financial success their creation has provided. We look forward to discussing this amazing opportunity with you!\n",

        "title": "SBA Eligible – Growing Personalized Gifts eCommerce Business – Sales Mix on Amazon.com, Jane.com and Etsy.com",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents an exuberant eCommerce business in the niche field of personalized and custom gifts. Offering entirely exclusive SKUs on popular eCommerce hubs, this thriving brand taps into the customer’s ability to send a powerful message to a loved one, and to give a gift that has incredibly heartfelt meaning. With these personalized gifts that serve to cultivate relationships, this one-of-a-kind brand has developed a strong, loyal following that is ready to be more fully developed in the hands of a buyer.\nThis brand operates on three popular eCommerce sites for custom made items: Jane.com, Etsy and Amazon Handmade. The transition of gift shopping trends from brick-and-mortar stores to an online presence has been extraordinarily successful. It allows customers to search out specialized and eclectic gifts that are not brand names but that helps them send a stronger message to their loved one. Online gift shops often have items with a unique style and look, which enables them to build up a loyal customer base.\nLaunched just two years ago, this company has been able to expand its product line to hundreds of SKUs. Those items include color wallet inserts, necklaces, leather keychains, wallet card designs, guitar picks and many others. Billing itself as a provider of “easy gift giving for every occasion,” the brand has watched sales accelerate in the last year.\nPersonalization has been a key factor in the brand’s success, with customized photo items a top service that has been enlarging their customer base. That includes popular items such as engraved metal photo cards and photo guitar picks. By integrating the customer’s photos into the custom-made products, the gift helps the customer celebrate their most important moments or the people they love most. With an average order value of $20-40, this brand has experienced strong year over year sales growth.\nWith business practices designed to encourage upsells, this company offers a customized message and theme that can be applied to births, anniversaries, graduations, the loss of a loved one, or special occasions and celebrations. In doing so, these gifts tap into the customers’ emotions and as a result, sales have continued to get stronger as people become more familiar with this unique gift shop and the products they offer.\nThe brand’s popular metal wallet cards – which make up 70% of all sales – are entirely sourced in the U.S., along with their leather products. The rest of the company’s items are sourced from India and China, from suppliers that the current owner has collaborated with and developed strong relationships with over the past 10 years.\nDuring the past two years, sales have tended to remain steady year-round, with sharp increases around popular gift-giving dates and events, including Valentine’s Day, Father’s Day and the Christmas holiday season. Sales can also rise in the weeks leading up to the holidays as customers start preparing for these crucial gift giving dates.\nDuring these peak periods, the company can ship several hundred items per day.\nThe company’s SKUs appeal most strongly to women; their demographics include women between the age of 17 and 45, often purchasing gift items for their husbands, boyfriends, or fathers. The brand has also found considerable success with pet-themed gifts and receives a growing number of requests for items such as guitar picks that have photos of a beloved family pet on it.\nA fast-growing percentage of this brand’s sales now come from repeat customers.\nThis brand has done well on all three of its sales platforms. The listings on Jane.com make up half of all sales. Jane limits the type of products that can be offered on its site, so this brand has low competition there and is included in the market efforts that the site does. That’s helped the brand to enjoy organic traffic that has made this company a top seller on Jane.\nEtsy makes up 35% of sales, and the brand has enjoyed a sky-high 5 Star Sellers rating from its customers there. The company has a similarly high 4.5 Star Seller Rating on Amazon Handsome, which represents a growing 15% of sales.\nOperating on Jane and Etsy have been greatly beneficial in terms of marketing. Etsy ads are promoted by the host site, and the brand has received 53,000+ visitors to that site so far this year.\nThe organic traffic that both of these eCommerce sites generate has enabled this business to boost sales without employing more traditional marketing tactics, such as social media and email marketing campaigns, or an SEO program that includes a blog. That represents one of the clearest and most assured ways to scale this business. The brand could launch posts on popular social media sites such as Facebook, Pinterest and TikTok, while running ads on and making items available for sale on Facebook and Instagram. This enables the brand to drive the discovery and sales of their products where customers are already shopping – on these social media giants followed by millions.\nThere are other options for growing this business at an exponential rate. One would be to continue expanding the SKUs, providing customers with more choices. Rather than finding variations on products already being sold, the company could develop new ones.\nThat could include a new and much larger number of products that are geared around pets. So far, sales indicate that pet products attract a large customer base.\nThe company could also double down on efforts to build up a larger customer base on Amazon, which is an obvious path for stronger revenues. That could include running PPC ads on Amazon and using SEO keywords in the product descriptions to boost traffic. As Amazon remains considerably larger than either Jane or Etsy, there is massive potential to scale rapidly through this approach.\nBecause this brand’s products are specially crafted and not available anywhere else, the current owner has offered to remain onboard post-acquisition to help the new owner succeed at making this company profitable. This sale would include the company’s 3 Epilog Laser Engravers, two of them brand new and fully warranted, that are critical for making the engraved products they sell.\nBecause of the current owner’s hands-on involvement in making the products, the owner works as much as 60 hours per week during peak times, although the workload is much lower during non-peak times. During peak times one person is needed to ship orders.\nThis company has developed a strong footing in the niche field of personalized gift giving, and the emotional appeal of the brand’s products and the desire to use gift giving to make a strong statement has brought this company a lot of repeat business. Having accomplished this much in just two years, the brand is well positioned to use advanced marketing techniques and improved use of Amazon to take profits to the next level.",

        "title": "MultiBranded Amazon FBA eCommerce Retailer in Wine Accessories & Hunting Gear – Strong YOY Sales",
        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents the opportunity to own two unique, distinctive, and quite lucrative eCommerce Brands (aka Amazon FBA Businesses). One is an Amazon Best Seller for gun slings and archery wrist slings, while the second markets uniquely designed wine openers. With the majority of sales happening on Amazon, the two brands have amassed a tremendous level of revenue. The company has found a highly receptive market for both niche brands in both the B2C and wholesale markets and they are experiencing steady growth in sales year over year.\nBoth brands have unique scale opportunities. That includes an increased focus on B2B sales by targeting wholesale channels such as wineries, sporting goods stores and gun stores, and by launching additional products, since the brand now has an additional 54 SKUs ready to launch. Advanced digital marketing techniques could also boost traffic to both sites.\nThe company was launched six years ago to market products in the niche fields of gun and wine accessories. These were products that the owner personally enjoyed using and felt others would as well. Their products are sourced in China although all their patented wine openers are exclusive to this company, which has an agreement in place with the manufacturer. The wine openers also have a higher average order value of $39.56, compared to the gun slings, which have an AOV of $17.99.\nThe paracord slings remain their top seller, or 55% of all sales, while the wine openers represent 38% of sales.\nThe company has developed a line of 88 SKUs, which include 18 wine openers and 70-gun slings. The company now has 6 patents and 4 trademarks on these products. While sales are mainly on their Amazon platform, they have also started to see a healthy rise in sales on their Shopify store, and they now utilize Shopify to process all wholesale orders.\nThe brand now ships its products using Fulfilled By Amazon, although wholesale orders are shipped out of their warehouse. They tend to maintain up to $200,000+ in inventory, particularly during peak seasons. While sales remain steady throughout the year, both brands tend to see sharp increases in sales during the holiday season, and the wine opener in particular has become a popular holiday gift item. Sales have been extraordinarily strong on Amazon and the company has a 97% Positive Lifetime rating on the site.\nTheir loyal customer base has been highly enthusiastic about these products. The wine opener site enjoys 100% positive feedback based on 51 ratings, while the gun slings site has a 97% positive feedback score based on 269 ratings.\nThey have several top sellers on Amazon. Paracord Archery Wrist Slings have become a #1 Best Seller in Archery Wrist Slings, while the Paracord Gun Slings are a #2 Best Seller in that category. All the company’s Amazon SKUs are sold Prime.\nTheir highly effective marketing campaign has included using Amazon PPC on all accounts, and the use of social media posts on Facebook and Instagram for both brands.\nWith multiple websites that are doing well, this company is uniquely positioned for rapid growth. Scale opportunities include growing the company’s wholesale channels to different industries, including wineries, sporting goods stores, and gun stores. The company already has a strong start on this front.\nThe company could also expand its SKUs, launching additional patented wine opener designs that could include Football, Bullets, and a Wine Bottle.\nThe company could also boost its email marketing campaigns and social media accounts to attract more organic traffic, and with most sales now occurring in the U.S., the company could target more international sales by boosting its presence – and advertising – on Amazon’s European platforms.\nThe current ownership now works 10 hours per week on this business, with primary tasks that include making sure products stay ordered and are in stock. The company employs one contractor, a virtual assistant who helps with various projects.\nThere are no special skills needed to operate this business, which is a highly efficient automated businesses with minimal owner involvement.\nHowever, the new owner would benefit by having about 3 months’ worth of inventory, or about $85,000 worth, as their initial level of working capital.\nBoth the gun and the wine industries are booming fields today on a global scale. They are worth billions in sales, and these two industries also help create a lot of sales for accessory products. This company recognized that and has demonstrated tremendous success finding a receptive audience for both their high-quality gun slings and their unique and beautifully crafted wine openers.\nThe fortunate buyer will get two thriving marketplaces for totally separate and distinct products, both receiving rave reviews from customers and enjoying steady sales year-round. There are opportunities to scale both sites, including through new digital marketing campaigns, diversification of the product line, and an increased emphasis on the wholesale market. With gun slings being very much a practical purchase and the wine openers a popular gift item, these two brands are likely to experience exponential growth in the years ahead.",

Carrying a widely appealing array of services through its own software development along with technical partnerships, this SBA Pre-Qualified opportunity partners with companies large and small to offer products and services to medium sized companies as well as Fortune 500 customers.\nRegarding the SBA 7(A) Loan Opportunity, we have worked with our lending partners to review the business and it has been pre-qualified to go through the 7A program – which means that a qualified buyer can acquire this business for as little as 5-10% down and pay down the loan over an entire decade. Interest Rates are the lowest they have been in years – what a great opportunity to ROI through the M&A process on a business that has been in business for almost 3 decades.\nOffering 9 services to its clients, this business earns new leads every month and leverages a salesforce database of more than 2,000 contacts to reach and retarget qualified clients and leads.

        "detail_description": "Website Closers®presents a thriving eCommerce leader within the vibrant niche of eco-friendly kitchenware items. Leveraging the most popular eCommerce websites, the company has focused on one niche business line: various Unbleached, Exact-Fit Parchment Sheets for cooking and baking. This brand’s sales are so strong that repeat orders have become the norm.\nThe brand’s online ratings are very high. Revenues have been boosted by the brand’s messaging, which is directed toward environmentally conscious consumers, especially a female demographic, who are committed to purchasing sustainable consumer products. In 2020 alone, this growing business saw almost $500,000 in gross revenue and there is no limit to their scale opportunities.\nGrowing quickly over the past 4 years, this brand has high ranking storefronts on a multitude of channels, including Amazon and Shopify, with a lucrative, established presence throughout Amazon Europe. There is tremendous room to expand into the UK and other European markets.  With excellent ranking for several of its products, a subscriber list of 1,550+, and an additional email database of past orders from Amazon customers that exceeds 8,000+ qualified leads; this brand is strategically primed for retargeting, Facebook, and other social media marketing practices. All of their SKUs on Amazon are 4.7 – 5 Star, with thousands of reviews in place.\nIntroducing a line of new products could increase this company’s sales and market reach impactfully. In fact, there are 5 SKUs already in development that promise incredible market adoption rates. While the brand has mostly relied on eCommerce sales so far, the company has started to receive lucrative B2B wholesale orders that represent monumental growth opportunities. Targeting restaurants, bakeries, and cafés to drive consistent wholesale purchasing could prove extremely promising. Likewise, this company could experience growth by exploring the potential for brick-and-mortar sales in big box stores such as Walmart, Target, and local grocery chains.\nHistorically popular for use in restaurants and other food serving establishments, these parchment papers are coated in a layer of silicone to give it a nonstick quality while making it heat-and water-resistant – are now equally common for at home kitchens as well. Built on a foundation of convenience, sustainability, and flexibility, this company is strategically developed to drive lasting success.\nAs part of its powerful eco-friendly standpoint, the company minimizes its use of plastic and designs all packaging in cardboard to reduce the glut of polluting plastics in the world’s waste channels. This brand also upholds its green reputation by requesting photos from the supplier of the final product and approving packaging text and design before any order is shipped. Additionally, they work to bring attention to non-profits and other positive brands to further promote their highly engaging message.\nThis company’s growth potential is enormous since the company can easily expand by taking any kitchen product and quickly creating a non-plastic, non-toxic, or eco-friendly version of it.  With an Average Order Value of $14-17, the business maintains consistent sales throughout the year with peaks during any holiday season when consumers tend to spend time baking at home. About 90% of products are currently sold on Amazon, where they have earned a 4.9 average seller rating and several SKUs have been ranked as a #1 Best Seller at various times.\nThe brand also has a Shopify website where they have seen a sales boom.  With continued success on both online platforms, this business can be operated without an office or warehouse. Leveraging their current growth, the brand is currently gearing up to offer products through a subscription model to capitalize on both their repeat customer rate and the growing profitability of ‘set it and forget it’ shopping practices.\nIn addition to having more than 1,300 email subscribers, this company has acquired more than 5,500 organic Instagram followers and 3,000 on their Facebook business page. Their active and extraordinarily successful SEO program includes an educational and informative blog that focuses on parchment facts, recipes, and crafts. Beginning to focus on nontraditional buyers such as pharmaceutical and CBD oil companies, as well as other companies that may be interested in their strong, unbleached parchment paper, represent other powerful paths to growth.\nSince the company’s main overhead cost is shipping, growing the wholesale brand of this company could prove tremendously effective for maximizing profits. Shipping in bulk is considerably cheaper than shipping individual SKUs to retail customers, and a 3PL such as Amazon FBA could similarly lower this cost for their D2C sales.\nImproving on their current marketing tactics, an incoming buyer could engage in targeted Facebook advertising along with regular promotions sent to their expansive email database. There is a particularly strong growth opportunity to improve traffic to the company’s Shopify site through Google AdWords and PPC initiatives that could dramatically increase direct sales. This business is positioned to sell internationally across Amazon UK, France, Spain, Italy, and Denmark. With their Amazon Europe account fully set up, these proven products can easily begin to reach all corners of the globe to drive further expansion into more countries.\nThe current owner operates this company with one virtual assistant who works full-time. The owner focuses on running the daily operations, strategizing on how to grow the business, handling supplier communications and re-orders, and doing inventory management, logistics, and new product research while devoting part of each week to training on the latest trends in eCommerce.\nThis prosperous eCommerce brand is a leader in the field of eco-friendly and flexible kitchenware that represents a terrific opportunity to take advantage of the phenomenally successful model that’s been built so far. With an easily expanded profit margin, this company is ripe for scaling by a capable and business-minded new owner.\nThe brand’s focus on the environment and sustainability are crucial marketing factors that have led to its strong social media standing and rapid market adoption. With global consumers now spending billions each year on products marketed as green and sustainable, this brand has a growing audience that is willing to pay a premium for the level of goods they provide. As this market is set to grow dramatically in the coming years, this company will see ever-growing opportunities for expansion, market reach, profitability and more.",

From optimizing their own site to increasing the keyword power in each and every listing, this business has limitless room to grow through marketing tactics alone.

And with an investment in product creation, marketing, and reach extensions, an incoming owner could swiftly turn this international business into a world-renowned hub for all care items for infants to toddlers.

No warehouse is required, however there is currently a 200 sq. ft. space leveraged to process returns.

The current ownership utilizes only a credit card with a limit of $75,000 and running bank balance of $90,000 to run this entire enterprise. All purchasing investments come back with interest through Amazon in an average of 14 days. With lucrative cash back terms due to credit card points, a secondary, personal revenue stream is also created.\nSo far, Amazon targeted marketing focusing on top-selling products and major selling days such as Prime Day and Black Friday has been invested in. However, advantageous SEO initiatives and paid media placements can generate traffic across this company’s eCommerce storefronts and are sure to continue delivering a rapidly increasing ROI.\nThe scaling opportunities here are sizeable. Leveraging the prestigious and well established Amazon.com storefront has led to swift approval to sell some of the most well respected name brands in the world, including, ASSICS, PUMA, BROOKS, HURLEY, CUISINART, BLEU DE CHANEL, YETI, HUGGIES and FOLGERS; just to name a few. A strong set of relationships with suppliers allows for an immense opportunity to rapidly scale inventory with in-demand and exclusive products. This, along with new sales channels such as, eBay, Walmart, Etsy, and international market expansion will create unprecedented profits, skyrocketing your bottom-line nearly instantly.\nOverall, this opportunity is an incredible investment for an existing eCommerce empire, a savvy internet entrepreneur, or a brick-and-mortar owner in any of this business’ spanning industries to serve as a solid start to their digital retail efforts. Perfectly positioned to springboard any new owner into consistent success and profits, this company is an amazing fit for almost any buyer with almost any growth goal. This is a gem of a business – well established and carrying a fantastically lucrative as well as convenient model. It simply needs a business-minded owner with vision who can take this offering to the next level. Do not let this one pass you by.",

There are 8 Parent Products and a number of Child Products currently offered, with 10-15 products in various stages of R&D.\nThis Internet Company has proven itself year over year and has done exceedingly well throughout the pandemic. Nearly every product offered holds a ranking at or near 5 full stars – an accomplishment very few have achieved in the Baby Vertical. The Company sells UV Light Sanitizers, Food Processors for Babies, Baby Feeding Sets, Teething Sets, Toddler Plates & Bowls and Freezer Tray Sets, all in compliance with the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\nThe company is currently only focused on developing the brand using the Amazon Sales Channel, where customer acquisition cost is low and where most mothers begin their shopping experience for children’s products. Now that the foundation has been set, the company is cash flowing very well and in a prime position to begin focusing on additional sales channels, product verticals and international sprawl.\nAdditional sales channels that are immediately available include its Branded Website and other online Retail Channels, like Walmart, Target and BuyBuyBaby. Amazon International is an immediate opportunity, where the process has already begun. This is the perfect business for an entrepreneur to get into a scaling online company and learn the “Amazon Way” from an individual that has created a high Average Order Value in a super exciting sector (baby, toddler & kids consumer products).\nThanks to a diverse product assortment and category array, this internet retailer sees low seasonality risk since babies are born every day of the year. On average, the brand sees a $98 average ticket value (amazing!) year-round and is well represented through high quality imaging and product descriptions. This AOV allows for strong margins that allow the company more leeway in brand and customer development. The company has a small support team, and ownership is interested in continuing in the business after closing if that is the desire of the ultimate buyer. The perfect Buyer for this company in the eyes of the Seller is one that can bring forth experience, capital, connections and opportunity; the Sellers plan to be very specific with whom they partner since retaining equity is likely for this transaction, and a Seller preference.\nRelocation to anywhere in the world is possible as no physical location is necessary. No previous experience with eCommerce is necessary for this business – everything will be trained after closing as part of the transition. This company has built itself atop an easy to run, low overhead model requiring zero office and no warehouse overhead, eliminating the need to deal with large employee or office expenditures. Amazon’s Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) program is utilized for all pick, pack, and shipping needs, reducing the need to deal with or ship products from its own warehouse. With a low necessary workload based on current sales, and although this business is scaling organically on its own, a new owner can choose to run the business as is, and reap the rewards, or to invest in the growth of the company, which primarily would be simply through the acquisition of inventory to begin selling on other channels and internationally.\nSituated for scale in a variety of directions, this baby brand is ready for expansion into almost any international channel and would be any easy addition to the Amazon Europe and Asian markets, wholesale brick & mortar, and other segment-leading – all potent ROI investments, this business is a ripe opportunity for the entrepreneur of almost any skill level.",

        "detail_description": "This business is an eCommerce Retailer that offers products in a number of categories, including Musical Instruments, Sporting Goods and Essential Personal Items. Sales primarily generate via Amazon.com where they hold the Buy Box on a large number of the 6,000 SKUs sold. All suppliers are located in the United States. The business has achieved exponential growth since inception and continues to see significant profit growth throughout the COVID0-19 pandemic.\nA unique opportunity across several high demand verticals, this business has perfected the unique approach of identifying and sourcing high-demand, high-profit products to ensure market demand.  The business requires minimal capital operating investment, and significant market share can be captured with minimal ad-spend. This is a clean, focused operation ripe for international expansion and continued growth.\nThe Company’s books and records are clean. A qualified buyer has the opportunity to acquire this business very easily and at very reasonable interest rates, using our Lending Partners.\nThis target uses software tools to identify the most profitable products sold on Amazon, and that can easily be sourced from other US-based suppliers online. They then quickly list those products to take advantage of the high margins.\nOver 6000 SKU’s are divided among some of the most in demand market segments in e-commerce, including musical instruments, sporting goods, and essential personal items. Inventory is divided into:\n-Musical instruments (Guitars are the biggest seller)\n-Sporting goods (make up 70% of sales)\n-All types of home repair and maintenance items\nAll products are 100% USA sourced, creating a short lead-time. Drop Ship makes up the majority of shipping, less than 5% is done via Amazon FBA stock – requiring little to no warehouse space. The fulfillment center prepares products by removing supplier details and pricing, and the business usually receives a minimum of 20% margin on all products.\nThis is a largely hands-off opportunity once a cadence is established. Current owner dedicates 20 hours a week identifying products, placing orders, and general customer support. There is one virtual assistant, which could easily be expanded to two. No warehouse is required (current facilities maintain a 200 sq. ft. space to process returns), so, new owners are free to set up from anywhere they wish. Additionally, no inventory means no unsold inventory to manage, and a minimal initial investment.\nNo huge working capital needed – a credit card with a limit of $40,000 and a running balance of $35,000 in their business account has been sufficient for current owners.  Whatever is spent on purchases comes back through Amazon in 14 days. And cash back from credit card points is a whole additional personal revenue stream.\nSome Amazon targeted marketing around top-selling products and around major selling days such as Prime Day and Black Friday has been invested in, but SEO efforts to bring buyers to the website have been amply successful up to this point.\nScaling opportunities here are sizeable – mainly leveraging the prestigious and well established Amazon account for easy approval to sell some of the most well respected names in the world including COLUMBIA, ASSICS, PUMA, BROOKS, HURLEY, CUISINART, BLEU DE CHANEL, YETI, HUGGIES and FOLGERS – to name a few. A strong relationship with suppliers, allows for an immense opportunity to scale up inventory with in-demand and exclusive products. New sales channels can also be explored, including eBay, Walmart, and Etsy, as well as international expansion which could see profits, skyrocket nearly instantly.\nThis is a gem of a business – well established and with a fantastic model in place. It’s simply waiting for a person who can identify the right kind of profitable products to keep its momentum. Do not let this one pass you by.",

        "detail_description": "The business is a unique player in the Trampoline Accessories sector, providing products at eCommerce (primarily Amazon.com) that support backyard fun, like Trampoline Lights, Music and Sprinklers. The company is very easy to run, using the Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) model and has iterated over time to provide fun, attractively-packaged products that make trampolines more fun at a price point that sits in the range of impulse buy with many customers buying more than one product at a time. This branded and trademarked Internet Business has endless opportunities to scale by adding new products and expanding internationally. Current owners have product roll out plans laid out nicely, so new owners can step in to easily execute growth strategies.\nThe business is currently offering five equally successful SKU’s, which reduces any risk associated with concentration. The company also has a strong product development strategy in place with plans for several additional products to capitalize on the trampoline niche – which is ripe for innovation since there is very little competition.\nAll products are designed in-house and advertised under the company’s brand name. They have a trademarked parent brand, making them the exclusive sellers of all products. Owners have exclusive relationships with the production factories, which have proven to be extremely reliable.\nWork is light – averaging three hours per week checking stats and refocusing ad campaigns with current operations. There is one part-time customer service rep who works remotely out of Las Vegas, and this is also where a third-party warehouse occasionally receives inventory in before it is ready to go to Amazon FBA. Owners work remotely, requiring only a small home office. There is a significant uptick in traffic over the summer months, and around the holidays.\nThe business focuses on sponsored ads during the peak season with a 19.3% ACOS. This is an exclusively Amazon centric business, and their average 4.8 star rating and solid seller feedback approval rating has led to an astounding 169% YOY Growth Rate. And the products speak for themselves – with stellar customer reviews and feedback.\nScaling opportunities include expanding products lines – mainly selling an extended line of accessories, replacement parts, other outdoor sports games or even trampolines and nets. Eventual expansion should include approaching big box stores and expanding to other marketing channels like Shopify, Walmart.com, etc., which represents low hanging fruit that has been untapped.  This business can easily be scaled up with the right buyer to become the go-to backyard family fun brand.",

One focusing on cat lover novelty items (such as candles and clothing), one a branded luxury candle brand that has a larger number of higher priced SKU’s, and a bathroom accessory brand including bathroom rugs and another focused on bath and shower products. An average order value of $24 is in the consumer spend sweet spot, but still high enough to give the hint of luxury.\nNew owners will inherit a ready to go business plan for 2020 to grow the profit by 25-30% over 2019. Multiple scaling opportunities exist beyond this. E-commerce, in particular the home accessory market, has seen an uptick with the current Coronavirus Pandemic, making this is an ideal time to step into an established e-commerce business that is going nowhere but up.\nThe candles are products of the home of luxury, Italy, and manufactured in China. Each SKU is branded under one brand name. Inventory is kept in stock, branded and prepped, and shipped to Amazon as needed. A trusted group of multiple suppliers are all rock solid and dependable. All products are sold on the US and Canadian Amazon marketplaces – all FBA/ Prime, with overstock sent to the UK market.\nThis solid, easy to run business is manageable from anywhere, with a minimum amount of work time. (20 hour work week at most, but averaging 4 hours most of the year). Most work centers around sales maintenance and product development. This is a single owner operated business, but there is a contracted writer to maintain the blog, who can be kept on.\nImmediate scale opportunities include a combination of PPC/AMS advertising added at Amazon, which can be done by a new owner or outside advertising agency. Also, exploring other online marketplaces, like Etsy, eBay, and Walmart. Offline brick and mortar stores and exploring large scale sales opportunities (like apartment/home staging and refurbishments) can also work towards building rolling revenue. As always, the addition of new SKU’s and bundles should remain a priority. This is a mature brand, with thoughtfully established procedures in place.

Additionally, there is the potential for buyers to benefit from immediate tax advantages of acquiring hard assets (tractor trailers) through Accelerated Depreciation. Low overhead, low asking price, and plenty of scaling opportunities make this a perfect opportunity for someone looking to jump into this highly lucrative space.\nThe business is in the transport vertical, moving and distributing freight space across 48 states. Each load averages $1000 a day in gross revenue. Trucks typically handle 2-3 loads per week (average $5000 in a week). Drivers are typically paid $200-300 per day ($0.45 – $0.55/ mile).  Remaining expenses are fuel and truck maintenance as needed. Typically, $300 of fuel a day will last all day, driving nonstop. Per truck net profit is roughly $90,000 per year. Inventory and supply expenses are minimal.\nThis business has been operated in an agile manner and achieved balance with longer term contracts when appropriate. Current owners have been successful in securing more substantial contracts with large third parties like UPS and Amazon during peak seasons (holidays). These contracts provide consistency which benefits, and is attractive to, drivers and dispatchers. The market for drivers is competitive, better drivers cost more but are typically more reliable and help with customer satisfaction and more repeat customers.\nThe typical day for ownership is an early morning start (typically around 6am), beginning with a few hours to cover all trucks and then work ahead to book loads earlier throughout the week. The rest of the time is spent on-call and arranging contract drivers (negotiating salary). Current owner is willing to train, and introduce to key contacts (brokers, vendors and drivers) and how to best utilize each truck/ route to maximize revenue.\nMarketing consists of posting on job websites for drivers and posting on DAT load boards and Truck Stops for freight. Scaling opportunities include investing in more trucks to meet demand, expanding with brokers to access higher end loads, and expanding marketing efforts overall to ensure consistent volume.\nThere is no need for any industry experience in this business. The current owner will train. Just some just some negotiation and phone skills and you are ready to ‘hit the road’.",

This Private Label Brand is 100% Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA), requiring no warehouse space, workers or the normal headache that comes with warehousing and storing your own inventory. A laser-guided approach to brand and SKU development, this brand regularly sees Best Seller and Amazon’s Choice Badges across its ASIN assortment.\nAnd with 7 Virtual Assistants and an owner more than ready to not only properly transition the business to a buyer, but also teach the Amazon Way for 3rdParty Sellers, this represents a great business opportunity for a buyer looking to get into eCommerce, yet not start up their own brand from scratch.\nThe company has not had any issues form the Coronavirus Pandemic; in fact, since the business is solely eCommerce and selling on Amazon, sales have excelled and are doing even better during this unfortunate tragedy. This success during hard times will prove the company’s value proposition.\nThe business offers unique, fun, functional and great quality products in the kitchen and toys niches. Their kitchen SKU’s consist of a mortar and pestle kitchen tool, while the toy section features a trendy slime kit. The business is the leader in the ‘slime market’ using unique and fun add-ins to create the biggest variety of slime on the market. They have proprietary recipes that actually work, and copyrighted designs as featured on their high traffic Facebook and Instagram channels. Also in the works is a Slime School – which can be a bonus with purchase or a standalone product.\nTwelve carefully picked SKU’s are sourced from China, branded and retail ready. All FBA and all Prime delivery, these SKU’s are the perfect moderate price point at $21.51 average per order. The business enjoys a strong relationship with two main suppliers and two backup suppliers who are currently working on 5 new products expected to go to market in the summer of 2020. So not only does a buyer get the ongoing cash flow from current business operations, but the buyer also gets the ongoing benefit of the current growth trend seen in the run rate, but also gets the benefit of an almost 50% increase in SKUs, already created, sourced and ready to go.\nThe small number of SKU’s makes this an easy business to manage, with current management working 20 hours per week, concentrating on new product selection and launches. 7 VAs work remotely from all over the world, making this an ideal business for a jetsetter that can be operated from a phone or laptop from any location, worldwide. No office space necessary.\nMarketing has been concentrated heavily on Amazon PPC, Facebook ads, Instagram ads, email blasts and postcards. All sales are directed to Amazon (and SellerCentral) and all products are Prime. Amazon seller rating is 5 stars with 740 ratings. The Business runs Lightning Deals resulting in Best Seller Badges and they also enjoy many Amazon Choice Badges (badge ownership varies from day to day).\nLots of scale here, with expansion to international Amazon channels, as well expansion to other platforms including Shopify, Walmart, and eBay. The future is bright, if new owners concentrate on engaging influencers and brand ambassadors and developing new products in both the kitchen and toy lines, this could truly be a gold mine.",

Having been in business for over two decades, this amazing business has a 50% repeat customer rate, making it highly valuable and very low risk in the eyes of investors. Offering 514 Branded SKUs of RV water filtration systems including canisters, cartridges, water pumps, fittings, mounting brackets, pressure regulators switches, and purifying chemical products, this company provides premium quality, US-made water purification productions with the best customer service in the industry. This niche retailer sees consistent performance and great margins with over 150 visitors to its site per day and an average ticket value of $133.99.\nCurrently set up on a hybrid shipping platform, only 9% of products is drop shipped and the remaining is stocked and shipped. A third-party fulfillment center and warehouse manages inventory and ships orders daily. With stream-lined operations, ownership only works up to 20 hours per week maintaining the business. Thanks to this mixed shipping mode very little storage is needed making this opportunity a completely relocatable company that can be operated anywhere in the world. No experience in the RV segment necessary, as current ownership is willing to stay on as a long-term consultant after initial training.\nOnly 2 SKUs are currently on Amazon making this company one of its greatest scale opportunities yet. Expanding to Amazon and its FBA shipping platform (along with expanding to additional sales channels like Etsy and eBay) and increasing the product lineup are instant scale opportunities. Retail and more specifically B2B opportunities also exist with huge potential for instant revenue.\nNew ownership can quickly increase the current limited marketing with little investment if they increase SEO and Google AdWords, branch out to You Tube, or create successful email marketing campaigns by increasing its existing contact list of 1,100 subscribers. Currently not active on social media, this is perhaps one of the most expediential marketing opportunities available. Marketing campaigns could focus on Pinterest and Instagram targeting the naturalistic mom wanting clean drinking options in their RV’s, tiny homes, and van conversions without harming the environment.\nThe RV market is strong, and only growing as sales are thoroughly increasing with new baby boomers every day and millennials who want to take a naturalist vacation – this opportunity is gold in the hands of the right buyer.",

Taking these products into the Amazon channel would be an immediate sales opportunity, potentially doubling or tripling sales in a short period of time. Featuring suppliers of eco-friendly handmade material in both the US and UK, this business is exceptionally well-positioned to make the jump into Amazon, and expand internationally with maximum ROI on a minimum investment.\nBy employing a 100% in-house stock and ship model, remote fulfillment, Amazon FBA and/or drop shipping is on the table as an option to further streamline this already low maintenance revenue center which asks less than 10 hours a week of ownership with the help of 3 contract employees to craft branded knit products. Now offering 3 out of 20 available products on Wayfair.com and Houzz.com, this line begs for more product exposure and SKU diversification – Niche-specific expansion opportunities abound with sales channels such as RueLaLa.com and TouchofModern.com – all of which stand to build the brand’s presentation and capitalize on fully marketing the entire SKU lineup wherever possible.\nThis knit products retailer is a highly desirable niche play in a fashion segment with excellent staying power, huge online social viability, and a trending segment – priced to sell, this is an exceptional value as a bolt-on to any retailer already established in any number of related fashion verticals.",

The primary sales channel is Amazon.com US and UK, but there is ample room for growth both on and off Amazon. The company designs and creates all its own products, making it highly unique in the marketplace. Our review of the products, and their associated reviews, show an array of high end knives that are both visually stunning and of the highest quality. In business for almost three years, the company has already achieved TTM sales in excess of $3 million, with TTM earnings of over $950,000. Given the proprietary nature of the consumer products offered by this business, this is NOT your average internet company.\nThis eCommerce Retailer is the embodiment of how to properly create a brand – not just private label – but wholly owned and designed by in house staff so that the products offered are unique in the marketplace – not off the shelf products with a designer label. The beautifully-designed products are 100% proprietary and are crafted from only the finest materials. The Company has created an exciting and profitable niche in the Chef Knife space. Since inception, the company has developed and launched 5 distinct series of knives (45 designs in all) with a total of 89 SKUs (45 USA, 44 UK) with a variety of additional knives and other related items in development. A full 48 of the current 89 SKUs have been introduced since January 2018 alone. The Seller has strategically planned this period of rapid product deployment, working to almost double total SKU count, so that all SKUs will be velocitized well in advance of Q4, leading into an explosive holiday season.\nBecause the company also owns all associated knife tooling, these products are only manufactured for the company. Therefore, the knife design cannot be offered by any other company.\nSales are currently limited entirely to Amazon US and Amazon UK. This means that there are numerous immediate scale opportunities including the expansion into a huge market of untapped buyers via Amazon’s other markets. Additional growth opportunities include promotion of the company’s website storefront, the introduction of new products targeting both current and lateral categories, using the value of the brand to grow an affiliate base, as well as additional marketplaces such as Walmart, eBay, and Bed, Bath and Beyond, to name a few.\nThe company stores and ships all products through the Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) program. Therefore, the new owner will have no warehousing needs, making this company easy for transition as well as a 100% relocatable opportunity. This business has three performance factors that make it stand out from the eCommerce crowd:\n1. Scale. The Business is selling ONLY in the Amazon US and UK marketplaces, leaving a wealth of other markets untapped, including Amazon Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Mexico and Japan, dotcom, retail, etc.\n2. Branding & Design. The products are proprietary, and all are excellently branded with eye-catching designs and high-end packaging. These attributes can be used to scale the ecommerce storefront, especially on major search engines, while also opening doors to Big Box retailers.\n3. Appeal. Because the Seller has chosen to use only the finest materials and the highest quality production standards, any consumer with even the most basic culinary knowledge will immediately appreciate the product quality.\nIn the hands of the right marketing-savvy buyer, this company will be a stellar bolt-on opportunity to any business in this vertical, or a fantastic standalone brand to scale both on and off Amazon, keeping the company’s existing growth patterns on-target and climbing for years to come.",

        "detail_description": "The target is a Premium Exact Match Domain in a Luxury Goods Category that has been in operation since 2013. The company continues to generate over $600,000 in annualized revenue. The primary value proposition inherent in this business is not the revenue or the earnings – but the power of the domain – according to estiBOT, a domain appraisal and investment tool, the domain itself is valued at $225,000. This tool notes that ‘Massage Chairs’ as a keyword receives over 135,000 searches per month on Google, and over 680,000 SERP TERMs. Exact Searches for ‘Massage Chairs’, which directly leads to this domain is 6,600 per month.\nNot only is the domain highly valuable by itself, but there is also a going concern business operating on the domain – both through the website as well as on the Amazon platform – through a large number of vendors that have been in place for a number of years. The business has largely been ignored over the past several years as ownership focuses on other business interests, so there is a significant opportunity for a business already in the vertical to take this domain and bolt it on to their current operations. Or, a newcomer, looking to get into the Massage Chairs and/or Luxury Goods Space, could also use this as a platform and scale.\nScale for this business is enormous. For instance, because the domain is easy to remember and clearly recognizable as “luxury” in the eyes of consumers, adjacent verticals could be used for scale, including products sold in high end Barber Shops, Saunas, Spas and Salons. Professional equipment for Nail Salons, Hair Salons, Massage Therapists and more could be added, especially if a sales team is charged with the task of bringing on new clients via a wholesale program. An expansion into Movie Theater and other luxury seating and equipment would also be an easy add-on. Also, the company is regularly contacted by massage chair manufacturers to start a proprietary brand of chairs and accessories, which could do very well using the experience gained through 5 years of historic sales to build the perfect massage chair.\nAdditionally, the option for customers to purchase the chairs and other products sold on the website through financing was added a few months ago and is starting to take hold. However, only customers with very high credit scores are approved at the moment, which results in many customers being turned down (about 75% of all customers currently requesting financing are denied based on their credit). Adding more financing companies that service mid to low tier credit profiles could potentially cause a surge in sales. This is a fantastic opportunity to jump into a growing retail market with highly consistent growth and robust infrastructure immediately at hand.",

Hair loss affects roughly 50% of all women, and 80% of women experience noticeable hair loss by the age of 60. In the United States alone, 21 Million women suffer from hair loss. In 2018, the global hair care market is estimated to be worth about $87 billion US dollars.\nBoasting exceptionally stout profit margins on over $100,000 USD monthly revenue, the company is currently laser-focused on several core SKUs centered around hair care and promoting healthy hair growth and renewal. These products include: shampoo, conditioner, an Argan Oil hair enriching product, and a proprietary, in-house formulated hair growth vitamin product.\nThanks to a tightly focused and niche approach to an otherwise typically broad segment (hair care), this retailer manages to establish a brand and product offering differentiation value proposition that is unique in the segment – it also has successfully blended multiple approaches to hair care through vitamins, shampoos, conditioners and ointments through singular and various packaged offerings. The results have been powerful due to the growing worldwide need within the overall hair care segment and the evergreen nature of this particular beauty product and the consistently-trending desire for boutique-level, naturally formulated products.\nThis powerhouse retailer is averaging $102.00 USD per ticket price thanks to a high-volume, high-demand offering, including a packaging option for multiple hair care treatment opportunities – it is seeing almost 30% Repeat Customer Rates at its highly polished Shopify website storefront, and two of its core SKUs are shipping FBA though a 5 STAR Amazon storefront, currently only selling within the US market.\nHaving realized exceptional growth since inception and establishing a highly agile, low-overhead back end asking very little of ownership with only minimal paid advertising and social presence, this brand is an excellent play for new ownership thanks to standout scale opportunities waiting in the wings; whether you take this brand to retail store shelves, build an affiliate sales network, diversify into cross sell SKUs, or simply boost incremental revenue on Amazon with features like Subscribe & Save which are already available – this branded line is hitched securely to one of the fastest growing and evergreen segments in eCommerce today, and its continued success is all but guaranteed in the hands of the right owners.",

The company has a huge following on Instagram, achieving over 3,000 engagements per post.\nThe company is growing quickly due to its primary mission – celebrating the unique identities of its customers. The company believes that clothing is an empowering tool for self-expression that goes beyond the limitations of labels, which is why they are focused on gender-less clothing and accessories.\nWhat is really interesting about the niche chosen by the entrepreneur operating this business is the fact that LGBT purchasing power is now over $1 Trillion – rivaling all other minorities and representing a massive segment of the population ready to purchase consumer goods. The combined buying power of U.S. lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender adults rose about 3.7 percent to $917 billion last year.\nSeeing YOY growth and enjoying the flexibility of a 100% drop ship platform, this is a highly agile online retailer that has no concerns with inventory surplus or management. By not having the burden of holding inventory, the company is easy to transition and not heavily burdened by working capital concerns. Operating in a trending niche of a massively socially-driven sector, this company has found itself very well positioned for a great deal of future growth.\nAnd with solid books and records, well qualified buyers could purchase this great business for as little as 10% down using our lending partners at Website Closers. This is a great opportunity to ROI quickly over a matter of months, and to have the business pay down debt service over an entire decade.\nSelling exclusively on a highly polished, mobile-responsive website storefront, and boasting a desirable $42.00 average ticket price and nearly zero seasonality – this business enjoys a steady stream of repeat buyer traffic thanks to an organically-ranked online presence in conjunction with highly effective social marketing – over 74,000 followers on Instagram alone. Additionally, this Internet Business has yet to tap into direct email marketing, yet it includes over 15,000 opt-in email subscribers – an immediate marketing opportunity.\nAs noted previously, this business currently operates on a “drop-ship” model, meaning that all of the products that it sells are shipped directly from the company’s various suppliers. This is a great model where there is no need to purchase inventory up front, or to pay the expensive costs associated with warehouse and inventory management. All products are bought by consumers up front – and then inventory is ordered – a no lose model. All this company needs is a laptop and Internet Connection to continue operations, making it a 100% relocatable business, operable by almost anyone, anywhere in the world. This is also a fantastic opportunity to not only continue to grow the sales of other brands through the current supply chain, but also to take the lessons learned from other brands and to source products and create an in-house brand to boost profit margins.\nCurrently offering over 450 SKUs with considerable room left to grow the product line by adding additional SKU’s from existing suppliers (as well as new suppliers), this company is ready and able to instantly achieve scale by expanding into the most salient apparel/fashion and accessory sales channel in the world – Amazon.com. While the business has a strong Instagram & Facebook presence and minimal ad word spending, little SEO or paid online marketing has been implemented to date. This business sees healthy traffic with over 24,000 unique visitors monthly, on almost entirely organic traffic alone – making it highly visible and well frequented. And even a modest PPC campaign on Google and Bing could boost sales right out of the gate.\nOffered at a mid-tier valuation for an efficient sale, this streamlined and reliable eCommerce retailer is a good buy for just about anyone at any skill level – whether as a bolt on or a standalone revenue stream for the fast-moving entrepreneur of any flavor, this is a solid performer with plenty of room to grow.",
